asian exporters fear damage from u.s.-japan rift
  mounting trade friction between the
  u.s. and japan has raised fears among many of asia's exporting
  nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic
  damage, businessmen and officials said.
they told reuter correspondents in asian capitals a u.s.
  move against japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the
  u.s. and lead to curbs on american imports of their products.
but some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt
  them in the long-run, in the short-term tokyo's loss might be
  their gain.
the u.s. has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on
  imports of japanese electronics goods on april 17, in
  retaliation for japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact not
  to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.
unofficial japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs
  at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms
  said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the
  new taxes.
"we wouldn't be able to do business," said a spokesman for
  leading japanese electronics firm matsushita electric
  industrial co ltd &lt;mc.t>.
"if the tariffs remain in place for any length of time
  beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of
  exports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the u.s.," said tom
  murtha, a stock analyst at the tokyo office of broker &lt;james
  capel and co>.
in taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.
"we are aware of the seriousness of the u.s.
threat against
  japan because it serves as a warning to us," said a senior
  taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.
taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last
  year, 95 pct of it with the u.s.
the surplus helped swell taiwan's foreign exchange reserves
  to 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest.
"we must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and
  cut import tariffs to allow imports of u.s. products, if we
  want to defuse problems from possible u.s.
retaliation," said
  paul sheen, chairman of textile exporters &lt;taiwan safe group>.
a senior official of south korea's trade promotion
  association said the trade dispute between the u.s. and japan
  might also lead to pressure on south korea, whose chief exports
  are similar to those of japan.
last year south korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion
  dlrs with the u.s., up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.
in malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough
  curbs against japan might allow hard-hit producers of
  semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the
  u.s.
in hong kong, where newspapers have alleged japan has been
  selling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics
  manufacturers share that view.
but other businessmen said such
  a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by
  further u.s. pressure to block imports.
"that is a very short-term view," said lawrence mills,
  director-general of the federation of hong kong industry.
"if the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will
  be extended to other sources.
much more serious for hong kong
  is the disadvantage of action restraining trade," he said.
the u.s. last year was hong kong's biggest export market,
  accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.
the australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade
  talks between the u.s. and japan with interest and concern,
  industry minister john button said in canberra last friday.
"this kind of deterioration in trade relations between two
  countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very
  serious matter," button said.
he said australia's concerns centred on coal and beef,
  australia's two largest exports to japan and also significant
  u.s. exports to that country.
meanwhile u.s.-japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the
  trade stand-off continue.
japan's ruling liberal democratic party yesterday outlined
  a package of economic measures to boost the japanese economy.
the measures proposed include a large supplementary budget
  and record public works spending in the first half of the
  financial year.
they also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency
  measure to stimulate the economy despite prime minister
  yasuhiro nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program.
deputy u.s. trade representative michael smith and makoto
  kuroda, japan's deputy minister of international trade and
  industry (miti), are due to meet in washington this week in an
  effort to end the dispute.
china daily says vermin eat 7-12 pct grain stocks
  a survey of 19 provinces and seven cities
  showed vermin consume between seven and 12 pct of china's grain
  stocks, the china daily said.
it also said that each year 1.575 mln tonnes, or 25 pct, of
  china's fruit output are left to rot, and 2.1 mln tonnes, or up
  to 30 pct, of its vegetables.
the paper blamed the waste on
  inadequate storage and bad preservation methods.
it said the government had launched a national programme to
  reduce waste, calling for improved technology in storage and
  preservation, and greater production of additives.
the paper
  gave no further details.
japan to revise long-term energy demand downwards
  the ministry of international trade and
  industry (miti) will revise its long-term energy supply/demand
  outlook by august to meet a forecast downtrend in japanese
  energy demand, ministry officials said.
miti is expected to lower the projection for primary energy
  supplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600
  mln, they said.
the decision follows the emergence of structural changes in
  japanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen
  and a decline in domestic electric power demand.
miti is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand
  outlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the
  agency of natural resources and energy, the officials said.
they said miti will also review the breakdown of energy
  supply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.
nuclear energy provided the bulk of japan's electric power
  in the fiscal year ended march 31, supplying an estimated 27
  pct on a kilowatt/hour basis, followed by oil (23 pct) and
  liquefied natural gas (21 pct), they noted.
thai trade deficit widens in first quarter
  thailand's trade deficit widened to 4.5
  billion baht in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.1 billion a
  year ago, the business economics department said.
it said janunary/march imports rose to 65.1 billion baht
  from 58.7 billion.
thailand's improved business climate this
  year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials
  and semi-finished products.
the country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the
  first quarter due to lower oil prices.
the department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6
  billion baht from 56.6 billion.
export growth was smaller than expected due to lower
  earnings from many key commodities including rice whose
  earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26
  pct and canned pineapples seven pct.
products registering high export growth were jewellery up
  64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct.
indonesia sees cpo price rising sharply
  indonesia expects crude palm oil (cpo)
  prices to rise sharply to between 450 and 550 dlrs a tonne fob
  sometime this year because of better european demand and a fall
  in malaysian output, hasrul harahap, junior minister for tree
  crops, told indonesian reporters.
prices of malaysian and sumatran cpo are now around 332
  dlrs a tonne cif for delivery in rotterdam, traders said.
harahap said indonesia would maintain its exports, despite
  making recent palm oil purchases from malaysia, so that it
  could possibly increase its international market share.
indonesia, the world's second largest producer of palm oil
  after malaysia, has been forced to import palm oil to ensure
  supplies during the moslem fasting month of ramadan.
harahap said it was better to import to cover a temporary
  shortage than to lose export markets.
indonesian exports of cpo in calendar 1986 were 530,500
  tonnes, against 468,500 in 1985, according to central bank
  figures.
australian foreign ship ban ends but nsw ports hit
  tug crews in new south wales (nsw),
  victoria and western australia yesterday lifted their ban on
  foreign-flag ships carrying containers but nsw ports are still
  being disrupted by a separate dispute, shipping sources said.
the ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented
  the movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels, they said.
the pay dispute went before a hearing of the arbitration
  commission today.
meanwhile, disruption began today to cargo handling in the
  ports of sydney, newcastle and port kembla, they said.
the industrial action at the nsw ports is part of the week
  of action called by the nsw trades and labour council to
  protest changes to the state's workers' compensation laws.
the shipping sources said the various port unions appear to
  be taking it in turn to work for a short time at the start of
  each shift and then to walk off.
cargo handling in the ports has been disrupted, with
  container movements most affected, but has not stopped
  altogether, they said.
they said they could not say how long the disruption will
  go on and what effect it will have on shipping movements.
indonesian commodity exchange may expand
  the indonesian commodity exchange is
  likely to start trading in at least one new commodity, and
  possibly two, during calendar 1987, exchange chairman paian
  nainggolan said.
he told reuters in a telephone interview that trading in
  palm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered.
trading in either crude palm oil (cpo) or refined palm oil
  may also be introduced.
but he said the question was still
  being considered by trade minister rachmat saleh and no
  decision on when to go ahead had been made.
the fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubber
  physicals on an open outcry system four days a week.
"several factors make us move cautiously," nainggolan said.
"we want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make a
  mistake and undermine confidence in the exchange."
physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffee
  added in january 1986.
rubber contracts are traded fob, up to
  five months forward.
robusta coffee grades four and five are
  traded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward,
  exchange officials said.
the trade ministry and exchange board are considering the
  introduction of futures trading later for rubber, but one
  official said a feasibility study was needed first.
no
  decisions are likely until after indonesia's elections on april
  23, traders said.
trade minister saleh said on monday that indonesia, as the
  world's second largest producer of natural rubber, should
  expand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development of
  the exchange would help this.
nainggolan said that the exchange was trying to boost
  overseas interest by building up contacts with end-users.
he said teams had already been to south korea and taiwan to
  encourage direct use of the exchange, while a delegation would
  also visit europe, mexico and some latin american states to
  encourage participation.
officials say the infant exchange has made a good start
  although trading in coffee has been disappointing.
transactions in rubber between the start of trading in
  april 1985 and december 1986 totalled 9,595 tonnes, worth 6.9
  mln dlrs fob, plus 184.3 mln rupiah for rubber delivered
  locally, the latest exchange report said.
trading in coffee in calendar 1986 amounted to only 1,905
  tonnes in 381 lots, valued at 6.87 billion rupiah.
total membership of the exchange is now nine brokers and
  44 traders.
sri lanka gets usda approval for wheat price
  food department officials said the u.s.
  department of agriculture approved the continental grain co
  sale of 52,500 tonnes of soft wheat at 89 u.s. dlrs a tonne c
  and f from pacific northwest to colombo.
they said the shipment was for april 8 to 20 delivery.
western mining to open new gold mine in australia
  western mining corp holdings ltd
  &lt;wmng.s> (wmc) said it will establish a new joint venture gold
  mine in the northern territory at a cost of about 21 mln dlrs.
the mine, to be known as the goodall project, will be owned
  60 pct by wmc and 40 pct by a local w.r. grace and co &lt;gra>
  unit.
it is located 30 kms east of the adelaide river at mt.
bundey, wmc said in a statement
      it said the open-pit mine, with a conventional leach
  treatment plant, is expected to produce about 50,000 ounces of
  gold in its first year of production from mid-1988.
annual ore
  capacity will be about 750,000 tonnes.
sumitomo bank aims at quick recovery from merger
  sumitomo bank ltd &lt;sumi.t> is certain to
  lose its status as japan's most profitable bank as a result of
  its merger with the heiwa sogo bank, financial analysts said.
osaka-based sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9
  trillion yen, merged with heiwa sogo, a small, struggling bank
  with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in
  october.
but despite the link-up, sumitomo president koh komatsu
  told reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its
  position.
"we'll be back in position in first place within three
  years," komatsu said in an interview.
he said that while the merger will initially reduce
  sumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand
  sumitomo's branch network in the tokyo metropolitan area where
  it has been relatively weak.
but financial analysts are divided on whether and how
  quickly the gamble will pay off.
some said sumitomo may have paid too much for heiwa sogo in
  view of the smaller bank's large debts.
others argue the merger
  was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch
  network from scratch.
the analysts agreed the bank was aggressive.
it has
  expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business
  and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the
  wisdom of some of those moves.
"they've made bold moves to put everything in place.
now
  it's largely out of their hands," said kleinwort benson ltd
  financial analyst simon smithson.
among sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to
  enter u.s. securities business by taking a share in american
  investment bank goldman, sachs and co.
      sumitomo last august agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5
  pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at
  least, the federal reserve board has forbidden them to exchange
  personnel, or increase the business they do with each other.
"the tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the
  fed was stricter than sumitomo expected," said one analyst.
but komatsu said the move will pay off in time.
"u.s.
regulations will change in the near future and if so,
  we can do various things.
we only have to wait two or three
  years, not until the 21st century," komatsu said.
komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes
  into the securities business at home.
article 65 of the securities and exchange act, japan's
  version of the u.s. glass-steagall act, separates commercial
  from investment banking.
but the walls between the two are crumbling and komatsu
  said he hopes further deregulation will create new
  opportunities.
"we need to find new business chances," komatsu said.
"in some
  cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust
  bank related.
that's the kind of deregulation we want."
until such changes occur, sumitomo will focus on such
  domestic securities business as profitable government bond
  dealing and strengthening relations with meiko securities co
  ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, komatsu said.
he said sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering
  the securities business here through its swiss universal bank
  subsidiary, banca del gottardo.
the finance ministry is expected to grant licences to
  securities subsidiaries of u.s. commercial banks soon,
  following a similar decision for subsidiaries of european
  universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.
but komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar
  decision on a gottardo subsidiary.
"we don't want to make waves.
we expect this will be allowed
  in two or three years," he said.
like other city banks, sumitomo is also pushing to expand
  lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to
  replace disappearing demand from big business, he added.
the analysts said sumitomo will have to devote a lot of
  time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the
  merger with ailing heiwa sogo.
"it's (sumitomo) been bold in its strategies," said
  kleinwort's smithson.
"after that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling
  around.
it will be the next decade before we see if the
  strategy is right or wrong."
subroto says indonesia supports tin pact extension
  mines and energy minister subroto
  confirmed indonesian support for an extension of the sixth
  international tin agreement (ita), but said a new pact was not
  necessary.
asked by reuters to clarify his statement on monday in
  which he said the pact should be allowed to lapse, subroto said
  indonesia was ready to back extension of the ita.
"we can support extension of the sixth agreement," he said.
"but a seventh accord we believe to be unnecessary."
the sixth ita will expire at the end of june unless a
  two-thirds majority of members vote for an extension.
bundesbank allocates 6.1 billion marks in tender
  the bundesbank accepted bids for 6.1
  billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securities
  repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank
  spokesman said.
banks, which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity,
  will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buy
  back securities pledged on may 6.
some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today as
  an earlier pact expires, so the bundesbank is effectively
  withdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market with
  today's allocation.
a bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that the
  withdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of credit
  policy, but was to be seen in the context of plentiful
  liquidity in the banking system.
banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the bundesbank
  over the first six days of the month, well clear of the likely
  april minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks.
the bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2
  billion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banks
  themselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity.
dealers said the bundesbank is keen to prevent too much
  liquidity accruing in the market, as that would blunt the
  effectiveness of the security repurchase agreement, its main
  open-market instrument for steering market interest rates.
two
  further pacts are likely this month over the next two weeks.
the bundesbank is currently steering call money between 3.6
  and 3.8 pct, although short-term fluctuations outside that
  range are possible, dealers said.
bond corp still considering atlas mining bail-out
  bond corp holdings ltd &lt;bona.s> and atlas
  consolidated mining and development corp &lt;atlc.mn> are still
  holding talks on a bail-out package for the troubled mining
  firm, an atlas statement said.
atlas, the philippines' biggest copper producer, said it
  had been hit by depressed world copper prices.
it reported a
  net loss of 976.38 mln pesos in the year ending december 1986,
  compared with a net loss of 1.53 billion in 1985.
the company said it had been able to cut its losses because
  its scaled-down copper operations in the central island of cebu
  started in the second half of 1986.
atlas said negotiations were continuing on the acquisition
  by bond of the company's existing bank loans and their
  restructuring into a gold loan.
a memorandum of understanding signed by the two sides in
  october last year said bond would acquire atlas' total loans of
  275 mln dlrs, to be repaid by the mining company in gold.
atlas said the two sides were also discussing equity
  infusion into atlas and the creation of a development fund for
  further exploration and development of the company's gold
  properties in the central province of masbate.
wilson banks, general manager of &lt;bond corp international
  ltd> in hong kong, told reuters the atlas statement on the
  negotiations was "reasonably accurate."
banks said bond corp was seriously considering several
  investments in the philippines but did not give details.
in its statement, atlas said development of the pre-world
  war two underground mines in masbate had been accelerated and
  the ore tonnage had increased, extending the operation's life
  at least until 1993.
china industrial output rises in first quarter
  china's industrial output rose 14.1 pct
  in the first quarter of 1987 against the same 1986 period, the
  people's daily said.
its overseas edition said the growth rate, which compares
  with a target of seven pct for the whole of 1987, was "rather
  high" but the base in the first quarter of 1986 was on the low
  side.
industrial output grew 4.4 pct in the first quarter of
  1986.
it said china's industrial production this year has been
  normal but product quality and efficiency need further
  improvement.
it gave no further details.
japan ministry says open farm trade would hit u.s.
  japan's agriculture ministry, angered by
  u.s.
demands that japan open its farm products market, will
  tell u.s. officials at talks later this month that
  liberalisation would harm existing u.s. farm exports to japan,
  a senior ministry official said.
"imports from the u.s. would drop due to active sales drives
  by other suppliers," the official, who declined to be named,
  said.
"japan is the largest customer for u.s. farm products and
  it is not reasonable for the u.s. to demand japan liberalise
  its farm import market," he said.
agriculture minister mutsuki kato has said if the u.s.
insists japan open its protected rice market it will also open
  its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to
  protect local farmers.
australia and canada could then increase their wheat
  exports as they are more competitive than the u.s., he said.
end-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.
u.s. agriculture secretary richard lyng, who is due to
  visit japan for talks between april 16-27, has said he will ask
  japan to offer a share of its rice market to u.s.
suppliers and
  remove quotas on u.s.
beef and citrus imports.
other countries are already cutting into the u.s. market
  share here.
australia, the largest beef supplier to japan, has
  been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year
  beef accord next march 31.
imports of u.s. corn have fallen due to increased sales
  from china and south america, while japanese soybean imports
  from brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although
  the u.s. will remain the largest supplier.
u.s. feedgrain sales will also drop if japan opens up its
  beef imports, since japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain
  imports, mainly from the u.s., japanese officials said.
an indication of the u.s.
position came last december when
  under secretary of agriculture daniel amstutz said japan has
  the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to u.s.
agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing
  some one billion dlrs in new business.
the u.s. has also asked the general agreement on tariffs
  and trade to investigate the legality of japanese import
  controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,
  purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,
  prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.
to help calm heated trade relations with the u.s., japan's
  top business group keidanren has urged the government to remove
  residual import restrictions on agricultural products.
but agriculture minister kato has ruled out any emotional
  reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue
  should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the
  industrial sector.
"japan is the largest buyer of u.s. farm products, and these
  issues should not be discussed on the same table," the official
  said.
amatil proposes two-for-five bonus share issue
  amatil ltd &lt;amaa.s> said it proposes to
  make a two-for-five bonus issue out of its revaluation reserve
  to shareholders registered may 26.
shareholders will be asked to approve the issue and an
  increase in authorised capital to 175 mln shares from 125 mln
  at a general meeting on may 1, it said in a statement.
the new shares will rank for dividends declared after
  october 31.
amatil, in which b.a.t.
industries plc &lt;bti.l>
  holds a 41 pct stake, said it does not expect to maintain its
  latest annual dividend rate of 29 cents a share on the enlarged
  capital.

u.k. money market deficit forecast at 250 mln stg
  the bank of england said it forecast a
  shortage of around 250 mln stg in the money market today.
among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
  in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
  some 505 mln stg, while bills for repurchase by the market will
  remove around 194 mln.
in addition, a rise in note circulation
  and bankers' balances below target will each drain around 110
  mln stg.
partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions
  will add some 690 mln stg to the system today.
south korea moves to slow growth of trade surplus
  south korea's trade surplus is growing too
  fast and the government has started taking steps to slow it
  down, deputy prime minister kim mahn-je said.
he told a press conference the government planned to
  increase investment, speed up the opening of the local market
  to foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to hold
  the surplus "at a proper level."
but he said the government would not allow the won to
  appreciate too much in a short period of time.
south korea has
  been under pressure from washington to revalue the won.
the u.s.
wants south korea to cut its trade surplus with
  the u.s., which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3
  billion dlrs in 1985.
kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospects
  were bright for the south korean economy, but the government
  would try to hold the current account surplus to around five
  billion dlrs a year for the next five years.
"our government projections of eight pct gnp growth, five
  billion dlrs of (current account) surplus and 12 pct growth in
  exports all seemed to be reasonable early this year.
but now
  the surplus is growing faster than we expected," he said.
trade ministry officials said south korea's exports rose 35
  pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of this
  year, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs.
kim said the swing of south korea's current account to a
  surplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlr
  deficit in 1985 was very significant.
the surplus enabled the
  country to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first
  time.
south korea's foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrs
  in 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largest
  in asia.
"this huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the
  major constraints on our development... last year was a major
  turning point for the korean economy," kim said.
kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of
  foreign debt to the country's gnp to about 20 pct in 1991, from
  about 50 pct in 1986.
"the government, however, does not want to accelerate
  reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus," he
  said.
kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation
  and lead to trade friction with seoul's major trading partners,
  particularly the united states.
"we need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, but
  we are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at a
  proper level," kim said.
finns and canadians to study mtbe production plant
  finland's national oil company neste oy
  &lt;neoy.he> said in a statement it had agreed with canadian firms
  to study the feasibility of building a plant in edmonton,
  canada, to produce a replacement for lead in petrol.
the prospective plant would cost an estimated 270 mln
  canadian dlrs and would produce methyl tertiary butyl ether
  (mtbe) from raw materials available locally, it said.
the partners in the study are neste oy, celanese canada
  inc, hoechst celanese corporation and trade mountain pipe line
  company ltd, of vancouver, b.c.
the edmonton site was suitable because of the raw materials
  availability, the proximity to pipeline transportation and the
  important capital and operating advantages gained by locating
  on an existing celanese canada site, the statement said.
the partners would look into the feasibility of a plant
  producing 500,000 tonnes per annum of mtbe, an octane enhancer
  that can replace tetra ethyl lead.
most of the mtbe would be targeted for the united states
  where lead levels in gasoline are being lowered because of
  health concerns, the statement added.
canadian lead limits are currently 11 times as high as the
  u.s. limit but lead is scheduled for virtual elimination in
  canada by 1993, which should create a canadian demand for mtbe,
  it said.
finland's neste oy, whose turnover last year was over five
  billion dlrs, has extensive experience with mtbe.
it has a
  major investment in an mtbe plant in saudi arabia.
the edmonton, alberta plant would be scheduled to go on
  stream in late 1989, the statement said.

german industrial employment seen stagnating
  the number of workers employed in
  the west german industrial sector stagnated in the last quarter
  of 1986 as a 50,000 increase in overall employment benefited
  only the services branch, the diw economic institute said.
a diw report added the general downturn in the economy
  since last autumn had had a negative effect on the willingness
  of firms to take on workers.
it referred to a marked downturn
  in the number of workers taken on in the capital goods sector.
new orders for manufacturing industry goods have mostly
  fallen or stagnated in recent months, but data for february
  finally showed a reversal of the trend, with a 1.9 pct rise.
bowater industries profit exceed expectations
  bowater industries plc &lt;bwtr.l> 1986
  pretax profits of 48.0 mln stg exceeded market expectations of
  around 40 mln and pushed the company's shares up sharply to a
  high of 491p from 468p last night, dealers said.
the shares later eased back to 481p.
bowater reported a
  32.4 mln stg profit in 1985.
the company said in a statement accompanying the results
  that the underlying trend showed improvement and it intended to
  expand further by developing existing businesses and seeking
  new opportunities.
it added that it had appointed david lyon, currently
  managing director of redland plc &lt;rdld.l> as its new chief
  executive.
analysts noted that bowater's profits of 18.9 mln stg from
  13.2 mln previously had been given a boost by pension benefits
  of 4.5 mln stg.
profit from australia and the far east showed the greatest
  percentage rise, jumping 55.0 pct to 15.5 mln from 10.0 mln,
  while the profit from u.k. operations rose 30.7 pct to 24.7
  mln, and europe, 42.9 pct to 11.0 mln.
citibank norway unit loses six mln crowns in 1986
  citibank a/s &lt;cci.n>, the norwegian
  subsidiary of the u.s.-based bank, said it made a net loss of
  just over six mln crowns in 1986 -- although foreign bankers
  said they expect it to show 1987 profits after two lean years.
citibank's oslo treasury head bjoern sejerstad told
  reuters, citibank, one of seven foreign bank subsidiaries
  operating in norway, lost money because of restructuring for
  investment banking away from commercial banking and an economic
  slump in norway following last year's plunge in oil prices.
foreign banks have been allowed to operate susbidiaries in
  norway since 1985.
foreign banking analysts in oslo said access to norway's
  second-hand securities and equities markets, to be approved
  later this spring, and lower primary reserve requirements would
  make profit this year.
citibank lost 490,000 crowns in norway in 1985, but
  sejerstad said a profit was likely this year because of planned
  liberalisation and better economic performance, helped by a
  steadier oil price of around 18 dlrs a barrel.
earlier this year, chase manhattan bank's &lt;cmb.n>
  subsidiary decided to stop foreign exchange trading after heavy
  losses and focus instead on fee-based merchant banking.
vieille montagne says 1986 conditions unfavourable
  a sharp fall in the dollar price of
  zinc and the depreciation of the u.s. currency created
  unfavourable economic conditions for vieille montagne sa

it said in a statement that the two factors led to a
  squeeze on refining margins and an 18.24 pct fall in sales and
  services income despite an unchanged level of activity.
vieille montagne, which is actively pursuing a
  restructuring program, reported a 198 mln franc net loss, after
  187 mln francs in provisions for the closure of an electrolysis

ec mainly for tin extension, no u.k.
stand taken
  european community (ec) members of the
  international tin council, except britain, have said they are
  prepared to back an extension of the international tin
  agreement, an ec spokesman said.
he said at a meeting of ec states' representatives here
  yesterday, britain undertook to communicate its own decision to
  its partners today.
it said it was not ready yesterday to take
  a stand but did not say why.
he added nine other ec states backed an extension.
spain
  and portugal, which are not members of the international tin
  council, raised no objections to a common ec stance in favour.
japan given little hope of avoiding u.s. sanctions
  a top u.s. official said japan has little
  chance of convincing the u.s. to drop threatened trade
  sanctions, despite the efforts of a japanese team that left for
  washington today.
michael armacost, under secretary of state for political
  affairs, was asked at a press conference whether japan's moves
  to boost its domestic economy and open its markets could
  persuade the u.s. not to impose tariffs on japanese imports
  said, and replied: "...it is probably too early for the figures
  to demonstrate that the situation has turned around and to
  permit the result you have described."
armacost said the u.s. hopes japan will take steps to lift
  its domestic economy and reduce dependence on exports, remove
  barriers to imports and settle outstanding trade issues.
"there are obvious problems at the moment in the trade area,
  but we do not wish those problems to divert attention from
  important areas of cooperation that continue to exist on
  security and political issues," he said.
"the question is whether through cooperative actions between
  our governments we can reduce the (trade) imbalance or whether
  congress takes action to reduce it through protectionist
  legislation," he said.
thai zinc exports fall in march
  thai zinc ingot exports fell to 882
  tonnes in march from 1,764 in february and 3,008 in march 1986,
  the mineral resources department said.
a spokesman for padaeng industry co ltd, the country's sole
  exporter, attributed the decline to the company's lower stocks,
  which averaged 5,000 tonnes in the first quarter against 16,000
  tonnes in late 1985 when it began exporting.
the department said major buyers included china, japan, the
  philippines, south korea, singapore and taiwan.
thailand exported 4,842 tonnes of zinc ingots during the
  first quarter, down from 14,937 a year ago.
ec sugar tender hard to predict - london trade
  the outcome of today's european community
  (ec) white sugar tender is extremely difficult to predict after
  last week's substantial award of 102,350 tonnes at the highest
  ever rebate of 46.864 european currency units (ecus) per 100
  kilos, traders said.
some said they believed the tonnage would probably be
  smaller, at around 60,000 tonnes, but declined to give a view
  on the likely restitution.
last week, the european commission
  accepted 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention by operators
  protesting about low rebates.
this might be a determining
  factor in today's result, they added.
north yemen calls sugar buying tender - trade
  north yemen has called a buying tender

anheuser-busch joins bid for san miguel
  anheuser-busch companies inc &lt;bud.n> has
  joined several other foreign bidders for sequestered shares of
  the philippines' largest food and beverage maker san miguel
  corp &lt;sanm.mn>, the head of a government panel which controls
  the shares told reuters.
ramon diaz, secretary of the presidential commission on
  good government (pcgg), said anheuser-busch had told the
  government it was interested in buying 14 mln "b" shares of san
  miguel.
he did not disclose the offered price.
diaz said australian brewer alan bond's bond corp holdings
  ltd had offered 150 pesos per share for the "b" shares.
diaz said new york investment bank allen and co inc had
  earlier said it was interested in buying all 38.1 mln
  sequestered shares.
he told reuters last month elders ixl ltd
  &lt;elxa.s>, the melbourne-based brewing company, had also bid for
  the "b" shares.
the hong kong economic journal last month quoted a
  spokesman of australian stock broker jacksons ltd as saying
  that &lt;barwon farmlands ltd>, an australian firm owned 30 pct by
  &lt;ariadne australia ltd>, was planning a filipino branch in
  order to buy the entire block of 38.1 mln shares.
anheuser-busch last year made a 150 mln dlr bid to buy &lt;san
  miguel brewery ltd>, a hong kong listed company which is 69.65
  pct owned by &lt;neptunia corp ltd>, a san miguel corp subsidiary.
the talks broke down last june after the two sides said
  they could not agree on the terms of the sale.
economic spotlight - australian markets booming
  australian markets are booming as foreign
  fund managers redirect capital away from the united states and
  other traditional markets, analysts said.
high short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market and
  an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of
  fresh funds in the last two months, largely from japanese and
  u.s. investors, analysts polled by reuters said.
fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in
  and have settled on australia, britain and canada as they
  diversify from volatile u.s. dollar instruments, they said.
a one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in
  the past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for the
  currency of 0.71 u.s. dlrs all illustrated the inflow.
official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital
  are not available, but brokers said they received almost daily
  inquiries from japan and the united states.
"these people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about
  and they don't know what to do with it.
some of that is ending
  up here with the attraction of high interest rates and
  reasonable currency stability," national australia bank ltd
  economist brian hamley said.
"there is a 'flight to quality'," hamley said.
"australia may
  not be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't too
  many other countries where you'd want to put your money."
the stronger australian dollar was also attracting
  investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against
  the volatility of the u.s. unit, analysts said.
"we're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the u.s.
  where some people would be concerned about the value of the
  u.s. dollar," lloyds bank nza ltd chief economist will buttrose
  said.
"why not put the money in australia where entry is cheap
  and the currency looks stable?"
but turning that capital into more permanent productive
  investment depends on government economic policy, he said.
"it will only disappear if people lose confidence in the
  direction in the economy," buttrose said, adding that offshore
  investors would carefully watch the government's promised tough
  economic statement on may 14.
while happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding
  interest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as
  easily reverse the flow -- particularly the japanese, who were
  badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the australian dollar
  and hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.
"it will remain very edgy money.
if something was not to be
  delivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, one
  might see a substantial outflow," buttrose said.
offshore investors are eager to see australia take tough
  economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and
  stubborn current account deficit, analysts said.
"they are giving us the benefit of the doubt and i think
  they would like to leave the money here," buttrose said.
reserve bank policy has also reflected the increased
  interest in investment in australia and the need to shield
  japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.
reserve governor bob johnston last week acknowledged an
  element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency
  policy when he said authorities could not take their "eyes off
  the yen" because of the crucial role of japanese investors.
analysts said they believed the reserve bank had worked
  successfully in recent months to keep the australian dollar
  within the range of 100 to 103 yen.
apart from its recovery against a weak u.s. dollar, the
  australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a
  trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.
offshore buying has also played a role in the booming
  australian share market.
it has followed wall street and other
  markets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the
  weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into
  equities, particularly in the gold sector.
the key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3
  today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while
  the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the
  same period.
the property sector is also sought after, with japanese
  companies that have invested heavily in the united states in
  recent years turning their attention to undervalued real
  estate, particularly in the tourism field.
analysts pointed to the recent sale of sydney's five-star
  regent hotel to japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs
  as indicative of the type of property being sought.
"they think they find good value real estate here which,
  with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of
  investment australia needs," buttrose added.
economic spotlight - kuwaiti economy
  kuwait's oil-reliant and debt-ridden
  economy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices
  will determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economists
  say.
crucial will be the ability of the 13-member opec to hold
  oil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the
  northern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.
bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of gross
  domestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year
  after contracting 8.1 pct the year before.
this was after taking into account inflation in consumer
  prices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.
factors depressing economic activity include the
  6-1/2-year-old iran-iraq war on kuwait's doorstep, which
  threatens the emirate's vital oil export lifeline through the
  gulf and has sapped business confidence.
but sentiment received a much-needed boost in september
  when, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis
  caused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensive
  new debt settlement program was introduced.
the share crash, result of a speculative spree in forward
  trading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.
the cheques were also used as collateral for consumer
  spending, thus generating an informal credit system.
much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are
  still owed by individuals and companies.
there was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs)
  in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which
  one-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as
  bad or doubtful debt.
but the government has repeatedly said it
  will not allow any banks to go under.
the new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of
  problem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether
  debtors have regular cash flows or not.
banks' shareholders and depositors will have their rights
  guaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance
  in a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector
  is the biggest after oil.
kuwait is better placed than any other opec country to ride
  out the oil glut, bankers and economists say.
kuwait has an opec quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd)
  compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last
  year by oil minister sheikh ali al-khalifa al-sabah.
but strategic diversification into downstream operations in
  europe several years ago and a hefty refining investment at
  home gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell
  over one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.
oil industry sources say kuwait is able to get an average
  2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed
  product such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as
  crude.
bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason
  for cautious optimism.
other reasons are low domestic
  inflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent
  years and signs government spending on productive sectors will
  remain steady.
external accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8
  billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below
  that for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit
  gulf.
kuwait's petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put
  officially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income
  of the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.
but for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these
  reserves may not be enough to prevent a "real" budget deficit for
  the 1986/87 fiscal year ending june 30, bankers say.
in a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary,
  revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct,
  doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.
this left out income from state reserves, usually excluded
  in official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at
  up to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some
  shortfall.
bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for
  economic growth this year or next.
"it depends on oil prices," one said.
"this summer is
  important."
cabinet affairs minister rashid al-rashid said last sunday
  the cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state
  spending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the
  economy.
he gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be
  spelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in june.
malaysia may not meet 1987 oil palm target
  malaysia is unlikely to meet its
  targeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar
  1987, oil palm growers told reuters.
output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes,
  unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliser
  and overstressed palms, they said.
the growers were asked for their reaction to an oil world
  newsletter report that malaysia's oil palm output is likely to
  drop sharply this year.
palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about
  115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but malaysia must sell more
  palm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage the
  industry, a leading grower told reuters.
the country's palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnes
  against about 800,000 last march, the growers said.
the growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this year
  due to pressure from south american and u.s.
soybean output.
the current south american oilseed harvest, mainly soybean,
  is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous
  21.7 mln tonne crop, they said.
in addition, new u.s.
soybean plantings are also expected
  to enter the market around november when malaysian palm oil
  output peaks.
they said new planting of palms is also likely to slow,
  with some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new trees
  against 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reduction
  will not be felt for about another three years.

monier says britain's redland may bid for it
  diversified building materials group
  monier ltd &lt;mnra.s> said talks are taking place which may lead
  to britain's redland plc &lt;rdld.l> making an offer for the
  monier shares it does not already hold, chairman bill locke
  said.
redland already holds about 49 pct of monier's 156.28 mln
  issued shares, he said in a brief notice to the australian
  stock exchange.
locke said shareholders would be advised as soon as the
  discussions progressed and recommended that they keep their
  shares.
monier shares were trading at a 1987 high of 3.10 dlrs
  today, up from the previous peak of 2.80 at yesterday's close,
  and well above the 1987 low of 2.18 dlrs.
monier is the largest concrete roof tile manufacturer in
  australia, the u.s. and new zealand and the world's largest
  marketer of fly ash, according to its annual report for 1985/86
  ended june 30.
it recently reported first-half 1986/87 net fell to 15.02
  mln dlrs from 17.09 mln a year earlier due to the australian
  housing downturn, although foreign earnings rose.
isuzu plans no interim dividend
  isuzu motor ltd &lt;isum.t> will pay no
  dividend for the first half year ending april 30, 1987, as the
  company is expected to mark a 12 billion yen parent company
  current loss in the first half due to slow exports caused by
  the yen's appreciation, a company spokesman said.
the company has paid no dividend since the year ended
  october 31, 1983, when it paid five yen.
it had a 4.44 billion yen current profit in the first half
  of 1985/86.
japanese official takes data to microchip talks
  ministry of international trade and
  industry (miti) vice minister makoto kuroda leaves for
  washington today with data he hopes will refute u.s. charges
  japan has violated a pact on microchip trade.
a three-man japanese trade team is already in washington
  laying the groundwork for talks between kuroda and deputy u.s.
  trade representative michael smith aimed at persuading the u.s.
  not to impose tariffs on certain japanese products.
but kuroda said he is taking no new proposals.
"i have
  nothing in my briefcase except an explanation of the current
  situation," kuroda told the daily newspaper asahi shimbun.
kuroda said the u.s. decision was based on incorrect data
  and an exaggerated sense of miti's power to control market
  forces.
"the u.s. has excessive expectations.
to stabilise
  supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess
  inventories since 1985 will take some time," he said.
kuroda also laid part of the blame for low u.s. chip sales
  in japan on a lack of effort by american firms here.
he said if he fails in talks tomorrow and friday to
  forestall sanctions, he will seek further talks with u.s. trade
  representative clayton yeutter.
u.s. officials said this week's
  talks are unlikely to delay imposition of tariffs.
bell group confirms standard chartered stake

  confirmed what its brokers warburg securities told reuters in
  london yesterday.
bell previously held 10 pct of standard.
bell chairman robert holmes a court, who is also a director
  of standard, was not available for comment on his company's
  intentions in boosting its holding and other company officials
  contacted here by reuters declined to comment.
nippon steel denies china seeking japanese plants
  nippon steel corp &lt;nstc.t> denied local
  newspaper reports that china has been seeking to buy steel
  plants from japanese firms which plan to suspend output under
  the recently announced rationalisation program.
the mainichi shimbun quoted nippon steel as saying that
  china's state planning commission and some chinese firms have
  asked japanese makers to sell them steel works and rolling
  mills to expand steelmaking cheaply.
it named no sources.
a nippon steel spokesman told reuters that china has made
  no such official request, and the company was not considering
  such sales at the moment.
but mainichi quoted nippon steel officials as saying if
  prices are reasonable, they would export their used mills to
  china.
the paper said china's crude steel output totalled 52 mln
  tonnes in calendar 1986 and that it plans to increase to 80 mln
  by 1996.
japan's steel industry rationalisation plan is aimed at
  cutting production capacity sharply over the next few years.
jardine matheson replaces "b" share by bonus issue
  jardine matheson holdings ltd
  &lt;jard.hk> said it will withdraw the previously announced
  four-for-one bonus issue of "b" shares and replace it by a
  two-for-five bonus issue of ordinary shares.
a statement said the firm expects to pay total dividends
  for 1987 of not less than 40 cents a share on the expanded
  capital.
jardine matheson decided to withdraw its issue because of a
  joint announcement earlier today by ronald li, chairman of the
  stock exchange of hong kong, and securities commissioner ray
  astin, that the listings of new "b" shares would be barred.
the official announcement said this will include the
  proposal by jardine matheson.
but the jardine statement quoted chairman simon keswick as
  saying: "we continue to believe that the issuing of "b" shares
  would benefit shareholders, and regret that they will not be
  given the opportunity to vote on the matter at this stage."
keswick said the "b" share issue will benefit jardine
  matheson's shareholders by giving the firm flexibility to issue
  ordinary shares for expansion in future without diluting
  existing shareholders' voting rights.
however, he added: "we certainly welcome (the secretary for
  monetary affairs) david nendick's referral of this very
  important matter to the standing committee on company law
  reform and are hopeful that the process will lead to the
  development of general principles which can be embraced by all
  constituents of the hong kong market."

bank of japan intervenes soon after tokyo opening
  the bank of japan bought a small amount of
  dollars shortly after the opening at around 145.30 yen, dealers
  said.
the central bank intervened as a medium-sized trading house
  sold dollars, putting pressure on the u.s. currency, they said.
the dollar was also supported by a major electrical
  consumer goods company, which was a speculative dollar buyer at
  around 145.25 yen, they added.
the dollar opened at 145.33 yen against 145.60/70 in new
  york and 145.25 at the close here yesterday.
indonesian inflation rate 8.8 pct in 1986/87
  inflation was by 8.8 pct in indonesia

  cabinet session to discuss the economic situation.
u.k. money market given 53 mln stg assistance
  the bank of england said it provided the
  money market with 53 mln stg assistance in the morning session.
this compares with the bank's estimate of a shortage in the

san miguel deal hit by more lawsuits
  a bid by san miguel corp (smc) &lt;sanm.mn>
  to buy back 38.1 mln sequestered shares from united coconut
  planters bank (ucpb) has been hit by two new lawsuits, sources
  in the philippine food and brewery company said.
a manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring ucpb
  from selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of smc's
  outstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings on
  april 21 on a petition filed by eduardo cojuangco, a former
  chairman of both smc and ucpb.
cojuangco said the coconut industry investment fund (ciif)
  and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares.
cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by ucpb and
  represented a blue chip investment.
his petition said ucpb's
  plans to sell the shares to smc were "a serious breach of
  fiduciary duties."
the smc sources said the proposed share sale could also be
  held up by a second derivative suit filed before the securities
  and exchange commission (sec) by eduardo de los angeles, a
  government nominee on the company's board.
de los angeles, who represents smc's minority stockholders,
  asked the sec to block the transaction, approved last week by
  the company's board.
on april 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the
  sequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per
  share.
de los angeles told the sec the company's retained
  earnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the
  purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of
  dividends.
de los angeles said the share purchase would also violate
  an smc agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt
  to equity ratio.
he quoted smc's chief financial director ramon
  del rosario as telling the board that the transaction would
  boost the ratio to 2.5-to-1.
in petitioning the sec, de los angeles amended an earlier
  suit two weeks ago in which he charged smc chairman andres
  soriano iii and nine other directors of violating their duties.
de los angeles' earlier complaint related to smc assuming
  last december a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by smc's hong kong
  subsidiary &lt;neptunia corp> for a down payment on the shares.
the loan assumption was again ratified by last week's board
  meeting.
an arbitration panel set up by president corazon aquino to
  resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by
  april 15.
"the amended suit filed by eduardo de los angeles is part of
  a continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard
  of the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early
  disposition of the sequestered shares," san miguel corp said in
  a statement.
"coming as it does, when san miguel corp and ucpb have
  reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of
  payment, this suit is in direct contravention of the
  government's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement
  of the controversy by april 15," the statement added.
a san miguel spokesman said he had no comment on
  cojuangco's court petition, adding: "any statement coming from
  us might be interpreted as adversarial."
meanwhile, ramon diaz, the head of a government panel which
  sequestered the shares last year, said soriano was not eligible
  to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a united
  states citizen.
the sequestered shares are split into 24 mln "a" shares,
  which can only be owned by filipinos, and 14 mln "b" shares which
  are available to foreign buyers.
smc sources said soriano personally was not among
  prospective buyers.
they said the shares would be purchased by
  the &lt;a.soriano> group of companies, smc, neptunia and unnamed
  institutional investors.
soriano was named as one of the buyers
  in a bid in march 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by ucpb.
the sale was aborted when diaz's presidential commission on
  good government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were
  owned by cojuangco, a close associate of former president
  ferdinand marcos.
cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the
  u.s..
the shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend
  announced last june.
"we have no objection to soriano buying the "b" shares," diaz
  told reuters.
"but everything is on hold now."
the smc spokesman said he did not know if the controversy
  would be resolved before the company's annual stockholders'
  meeting, scheduled for may 14.
san miguel corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion
  pesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in
  1985.
it said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of
  700 mln pesos, an increase of about 50 pct over 1985.
rain boosts central queensland sugar cane crop
  good rains of one to four inches in the
  past 10 days have boosted moisture-stressed sugar cane crops in
  the mackay-burdekin region of queensland's central coast, an
  australian sugar producers' association spokesman said.
as previously reported, the region has been undergoing a
  severe dry spell, partly relieved by scattered rainfall, since
  december, following the virtual failure of the summer wet
  season.
mills in the area have been reporting that their crops are
  beginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growth
  since the rains began, the spokesman said from brisbane.
although the mackay-burdekin crop outlook is much better
  than it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesman
  said.
but is too early to say what they will be and more rain
  is needed to restore sub-soil moisture.
elsewhere, in far north queensland, the bundaberg region
  and southern queensland, the cane is in excellent condition and
  some mills are forecasting record crops, he said.
initial 1987 crop estimates will probably be compiled
  towards the end of may, he said.
the cane crush normally runs from june to december.
french traders forecast ec sugar tender
  the european community (ec) is expected to
  award export licences at today's weekly tender for above 60,000
  and possibly up to 100,000 tonnes of white sugar after last
  week's award for 102,350 tonnes, traders here said.
they expected a maximum rebate of between 46.40 and 46.50
  ecus per 100 kilos, compared to last week's 46.864.
earlier, traders in london said the outcome of the tender
  was very hard to predict after last week's substantial award
  and the placing of 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention.
they said they believed the tonnage would be around 60,000 but
  declined to give a rebate figure.
italy's la fondiaria to report higher 1986 profits
  italian insurer la fondiaria spa &lt;lfdi.mi>
  said it expects to report consolidated group profit in 1986
  significantly higher than the 60 billion lire reported in 1985.
the company said in a statement that parent company net
  profit last year will rise from the 72 billion lire reported in
  1985.
consolidated group premiums totaled 1,700 billion lire in
  1986 compared with 1,490 billion the previous year.

nickel prices unlikely to rise much - shearson
  nickel prices are unlikely to rise
  significantly from current levels unless further steps are
  taken to reduce production, shearson lehman brothers said in
  its quarterly nickel market report.
the market had recovered slightly to around 1.72 dlrs a lb
  yesterday from its four year low of 1.55 dlrs in early january,
  due to the absence of soviet nickel cathode deliveries, but
  shearson sees soviet shipments soon returning to last year's
  buoyant levels, which should ease current tightness.
output reductions by producers will take effect later this
  year but are likely to be offset by increases elsewhere.
shearson said the nickel market will be virtually in
  balance during 1987, with total non-socialist world demand at
  556,000 tonnes, compared with an estimated 544,000 tonnes in
  1986, production at 505,000 tonnes (504,000) and imports from
  socialist countries at 47,000 tonnes (50,000).
it forecast prices will edge higher during the year from a
  first quarter average of 1.67 dlrs a lb up to 1.77 dlrs in the
  last quarter.
the year's average will be around 1.72 dlrs a lb
  compared with 1.76 dlrs in 1986, using london metal exchange
  cash metal prices in dollar terms and assuming an average 1987
  sterling exchange rate of 1.55 dlrs.
higher 1986 profit for dutch chemical firm dsm
  the fully state-owned dutch
  chemical firm nv dsm &lt;dsmn.as> said its 1986 net profit rose to
  412 mln guilders from 402 mln in 1985, while turnover fell to
  17.7 billion guilders in 1986 from 24.1 billion in 1985.
the company said 1986 dividend, which will be paid to the
  dutch state in its capacity of the firm's sole shareholder,
  would be raised to 98 mln guilders from 70 mln guilders in
  1985.
in an initial comment on its 1986 results, dsm said the
  drop in 1986 turnover had been caused mainly by losses in the
  company's fertilizer division.
poehl warns against further dollar fall
  bundesbank president karl otto poehl
  said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation
  of the mark would damage prospects for sustained west german
  economic growth.
in a speech to the institute of contempory german affairs
  here, poehl said "it would be an extremely risky policy to aim
  for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to
  correct the trade deficit."
he said the united states could face a vicious circle of
  depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that
  route.
poehl noted west germany had already taken steps to meet
  u.s.
demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy,
  accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating
  above-target money supply growth.
he said he would have been happy to have brought forward
  five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for january 1988 to
  the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced
  political constraints getting such measures through the upper
  house of the west german parliament.
but there were also limits to the impact west germany could
  accept on exports from a rising mark, he said.
poehl said west germany relied on exports for about
  one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial
  erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing
  demand at home.
"a further appreciation of the mark could even be an
  obstacle to further growth," he said.
poehl said the bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply
  growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and
  because external factors, including low oil prices and
  favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.
but poehl said west germany now faced a difficult dilemma
  over monetary policy.
the underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the
  reported negative inflation rates last year, and west germany
  was affected more than before by exchange rate developments.
"for the time being, we will have to focus our policy more
  on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary
  money supply.
but we must be very careful," he said.
he said he shared some of the u.s. concern about japan's
  trade surpluses, which affected european countries as well as
  the united states.
poehl welcomed the so-called louvre accord of monetary
  officials of major industrialized countries, saying the
  importance of the february 22 agreement to stabilize exchange
  rates had been underestimated.
all partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the
  right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he
  said.
"this was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the
  part of our american colleagues," he said.
but he said there was still a danger that the correction of
  the dollar's value could overshoot.

california biotech &lt;cbio> sees 1st qtr loss
  california biotechnology
  inc said it expects to report a loss of 1,300,000 dlrs to
  1,600,000 dlrs for the first quarter due to increased
  investment in research and manufacturing and a scaleup of
  production.
the company said research spending is running 50 to 60 pct
  above a year ago as it tries to commercialize its products as
  quickly as possible, and increased expenditures are expected to
  continue for several more quarters.
it said operating results
  will fluctuate quarter to quarter, depending on the timing of
  significant payments from commercial partners.
in the first three months of 1986, the company lost 150,000
  dlrs.
the company changed its fiscal year in 1986 to a
  calendar year from a year ending november 30.
for the first
  quarter of last year, ended february 28, california biotech
  earned 114,000 dlrs.

unilever seeks buyer for stauffer chemical

  prospectus through investment bankers goldman sachs and co
  seeking a buyer for &lt;stauffer chemical co> of the u.s., which
  it acquired with the recent takeover of &lt;chesebrough-pond's

australian foreign ship ban ends
  tug crews in new south wales (nsw),
  victoria and western australia yesterday lifted their ban on
  foreign-flag ships carrying containers but nsw ports are still
  being disrupted by a separate dispute, shipping sources said.
the ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented
  the movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels, they said.
the pay dispute went before a hearing of the arbitration
  commission today.
meanwhile, disruption began today to cargo handling in the
  ports of sydney, newcastle and port kembla, they said.
the industrial action at the nsw ports is part of the week
  of action called by the nsw trades and labour council to
  protest changes to the state's workers' compensation laws.

independent chairman for dutch cargo dispute
  the two sides in the rotterdam port
  general cargo dispute have agreed to appoint an independent
  chairman, han lammers, to preside over future meetings,
  employers' spokesman gerard zeebregts said.
lammers, queen's commissioner for the province of
  flevoland, will not act as a mediator but will draw up an
  agenda and procedures for meetings between the employers and
  unions on a work-practice agreement and proposed redundancies.
two months of strikes in the sector began on january 19 in
  protest at employers' proposals for 350 redundancies from the
  4,000-strong workforce this year.
the strikes were called off by the main port union fnv on
  march 13 following an amsterdam court's interim injunction
  against the redundancies on procedural grounds.
the court is due to make a final ruling on may 7 but
  zeebregts said he expected the judgment to go against the
  employers and they were therefore very likely to restart the
  complicated legal redundancy procedures in the near future.
meanwhile, the dispute over a new work-practice agreement
  in the port's grain sector continued, with 30 maintenance
  workers on strike, although loading was not affected, a
  spokesman for graan elevator mij, the largest employer in the
  sector, said.
the employers have written to the union asking it to
  reconsider its position and a meeting of union members has been
  called for tomorrow.

proxmire outlines insider trading legislation
  senate banking committee chairman
  william proxmire (d-wis) said he planned to introduce
  legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of
  corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders.
speaking to the national association of manufacturers,
  proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased
  the chance that congress will act to curb abuses.
"we are proposing legislation that would provide for more
  disclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would
  insure that takeovers are properly financed," he said.
among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold
  for notifying the securities and exchange commission that a
  investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a
  company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within
  10 days, proxmire said.
in addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement
  that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have
  to filed with the sec.
proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to
  prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in
  knowing about coming takeover attempts.
proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a
  tender offer must be kept open under the williams act to 60
  business days from the current 20 business days.
his bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring
  company violated the time period on the tender offer.
to correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, proxmire
  said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin
  requirments are properly enforced.
the federal reserve board has a 50 pct margin requirement
  for purchasing stock, but proxmire said it is not generally
  enforced in hostile takeovers.
rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover
  declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without
  actually putting any of their own money, proxmire said.
he said his bill would allow private suits for damages for
  failure to meet the federal reserve's 50 pct margin
  requirements.
the bill also would require more disclose when several
  investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover.
"when pickens and icahn get together we want people to know
  about it," proxmire said.
proxmire said he favored the approach used in britain
  towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all
  shareholders recieve equal treatment.
he said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover
  defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills.
proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this
  month and predicted the senate committee would act this spring.
he said he was hopeful congress could pass a bill this
  year.

bankers trust &lt;bt> puts brazil on non-accrual
  bankers trust new york corp said it has
  placed its approximately 540 mln dlrs of medium- and long-term
  loans to brazil on non-accrual status and that first-quarter
  net income will be reduced by about seven mln dlrs as a result.
brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs
  of medium- and long-term debt on february 22.
u.s. banking regulations do not require banks to stop
  accruing interest on loans until payments are 90 days overdue,
  but bankers trust said it acted now because of "the high
  potential of a continued suspension that would result in
  reaching the 90-day limit in the second quarter of 1987."
assuming no cash payments at current interest rates are
  received for the rest of 1987, bankers trust estimated that
  full-year net income would be reduced by about 30 mln dlrs.
bankers trust said it assumes that debt negotiations
  between brazil and its commercial bank lenders will lead to the
  resumption of interest payments.
the negotiations resume in new york on friday when central
  bank governor francisco gros is expected to ask banks for a
  90-day rollover of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt that
  matures on april 15.

stoltenberg sees moves to strengthen paris accord
  west german finance minister gerhard
  stoltenberg said today's meetings of major industrial countries
  would look at ways of strengthening the paris accord on
  stabilizing foreign exchange rates.
stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weakness
  of the february 22 agreement of the group of five countries and
  canada to keep exchange rates near the then-current levels.
but he declined to say what measures would be discussed
  ahead of a communique of the group of seven ministers later
  today.
stoltenberg and bundesbank president karl otto poehl said
  the importance of the paris agreement, also known as the louvre
  accord, had been underestimated.
stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among major
  countries than six months ago, at the time of the annual
  meeting of the international monetary fund and world bank,
  marked by sharp discord between the united states and its major
  trading partners.
"there is no fundamental weakness of the paris accord," he
  said.
"we will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but i do
  not want to discuss that here.
stoltenberg said the louvre agreement was working despite a
  "slight firming" of the yen against the dollar.
and poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchanged
  since february 22 without the bundesbank having had to sell
  marks to support the dollar.
"the louvre agreement has been honored by the market," he
  said.
poehl said west germany had lived up to its side of the
  bargain in paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be
  accelerated as a way of stimulating growth.
poehl said, however, that japan had not yet fulfilled its
  pledges for economic stimulation.
"and we will have to see if the united states is able to do
  what they promised in paris on reducing the budget deficit --
  and get it through congress," he added.
stoltenberg reiterated west german concern about a further
  fall in the dollar, noting that the mark was up 85 pct against
  the dollar and nearly 20 pct on a trade-weighted basis.
"you cannot expect that to go unnoticed in an economy.
and
  it is not just a german problem, it is a european problem," he
  said.

intervention board details ec sugar sales
  a total 118,350 tonnes of current series
  white sugar received export rebates of a maximum 46.496
  european currency units (ecus) per 100 kilos at today's
  european community (ec) tender, the u.k.
intervention board
  said.
out of this, traders in the u.k.
received 37,800 tonnes, in
  france 34,500, in west germany 20,000, in belgium 18,500, in
  spain 5,800 and in denmark 1,750 tonnes, it added.
earlier today, london traders had declined to give a
  projected view on the level of subsidy although some said total
  tonnage awards would be around 60,000 tonnes.
paris traders foresaw between 60,000 and 100,000 tonnes
  being authorised for export at a 46.40/46.50 ecu subsidy.
cumulative sales authorisations for the current season
  (1986/87) now stand at 2,194,970 tonnes (43 weeks).
last week saw 102,350 tonnes whites authorised for export
  under licences to end-sep at the higest ever rebate of 46.864
  european currency units (ecus) per 100 kilos.
mead &lt;mea> expects improved earnings this year
  mead corp said the outlook for its
  major paper markets looks strong for the second quarter and
  augurs well for its earnings in 1987.
"the generally strong outlook bodes well for significantly
  improved earnings this year," burnell roberts, chairman and
  chief executive officer said.
earlier, the company reported first quarter earnings of
  34.2 mln dlrs, or 1.09 dlrs a share, versus 20.3 mln dlrs, or
  65 cts a share, in last year's first quarter.
in 1986 the company reported earnings from continuing
  operations of 109.3 mln dlrs, or 3.50 dlrs a share.
mead said its first quarter benefitted from stronger market
  conditions and improved operations.
"the combination of capital improvement programs and more
  employee involvement has been paying off throughout our paper
  operations," roberts said.
he added that mead's pulp and paperboard businesses are
  operating well as prices have improved and strong demand has
  placed most products in a sold-out position through the middle
  of the year.
mead said sales of its unbleached coated paperboard was
  particularly strong, up 13 pct versus the first quarter 1986.

dutch sugar beet planting half finished
  roughly half of this year's expected
  130,000 hectare dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground,
  a spokesman for suiker unie, the largest sugar processor in the
  netherlands, told reuters.
conditions are generally good and the average sowing date
  for the crop is expected to be around april 11, against april
  23 last year, and a 10-year average of april 14, the spokesman
  added.
"it is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can
  expect when it comes to harvest in september, but at least the
  crop is off to a very good start," he said.
last year, the netherlands planted a record 137,600
  hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of
  white sugar, substantially more than the country's combined "a"
  and "b" quota of 872,000 tonnes.
this year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been
  introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000
  hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000
  tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota "c" sugar produced.
only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been
  allotted quotas.
this is expected to prevent the area being
  boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.

volkswagen dividend decision due tomorrow
  volkswagen ag &lt;vowg.f>,
  vw, is due to make a formal announcement about its 1986
  dividend tomorrow after saying the 1985 level of 10 marks per
  ordinary share would be held, despite massive losses because of
  a suspected foreign currency fraud.
a spokesman said vw's supervisory board will meet tomorrow
  to discuss the payout.
a statement will be made afterwards.
vw has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach
  their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln
  marks linked to the currency affair.
the figure is virtually
  the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit.
when vw first confirmed the currency scandal on march 10 it
  said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark
  dividend to the supervisory board.
a dividend of 11 marks would
  be proposed for the company's new preference shares.
share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of
  the management board proposal as virtually a formality.
"anything else would be more than a surprise," one said.
company sources said vw would have to dig into reserves to
  maintain the disclosed profit.
parent company reserves stood at
  around three billion marks at end-1985.

zambia does not plan retail maize price hike
  the zambian government has no immediate
  plans to follow last week's increase in the producer price of
  maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an
  official of the ruling party said.
last december, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for
  refined maize meal, a zambian staple, led to food riots in
  which at least 15 people died.
that price increase, which president kenneth kaunda later
  revoked, followed pressure by the international monetary fund
  (imf) to reduce the government's subsidy bill.
however, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67
  dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price
  increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies,
  a practice discouraged by the imf.
"there is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of
  meal.
it (the government) would have to choose between the
  demands of the imf and those of the people," a ministry of
  agriculture economist said.

further argentine coarse grain losses feared
  argentine grain producers adjusted
  their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop
  downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the
  end of march and beginning of april, trade sources said.
they said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates
  had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which
  has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.
however, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,
  producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain
  could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.
rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27
  millimetres in parts of buenos aires province, 83 mm in
  cordoba, 41 in santa fe, 50 in entre rios and misiones, 95 in
  corrientes, eight in chaco and 35 in formosa.
there was no rainfall in the same period in la pampa.
producers feared continued damp conditions could produce
  rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the
  crops, including soybean.
however, as the lands began drying later in the week
  harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40
  pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.
deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested
  material in cordoba, la pampa and buenos aires forced yield
  estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.
the season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at
  2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast
  last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of
  4.1 mln.
area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9
  to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.
maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area
  sown.
it is near completion in cordoba and santa fe and will
  begin in la pampa and southern buenos aires later in april.
production estimates for maize were down from last week at
  9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated
  previously.
this is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln
  tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and
  21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln
  tonnes.
maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to
  seven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.
sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in
  cordoba, santa fe and chaco.
harvest will start in la pampa and
  buenos aires in mid-april.
the total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3
  to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.
the new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln
  tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,
  and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2
  mln tonne crop.
the soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,
  remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5
  pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for
  1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of
  7.1 mln.
the area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln
  to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln
  sown in 1985/86.
the soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some
  areas and producers fear they may discover more damage.
some
  experimental harvesting was carried out in santa fe on areas
  making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on
  this were not available.
preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which
  will be sown between may and august or september, has so far
  not been as intense as in previous years.
dutch adjusted unemployment rises in march
  dutch seasonally adjusted unemployment
  rose in the month to end-march to a total 693,000 from 690,600
  at end-february, but was well down from 730,100 at end-march
  1986, social affairs ministry figures show.
the figure for male jobless rose by 2,000 in the month to
  436,500 compared with 470,700 a year earlier.
the figure for
  women was 256,500 at end-march against 256,100 a month earlier
  and 259,400 at end-march 1986.
on an unadjusted basis total unemployment fell by 16,500 in
  the month to end-march to 692,200.
in march 1986 the figure was
  725,000.
a ministry spokesman said the unadjusted figures showed a
  smaller than usual seasonal decrease for the time of year,
  because of particularly cold weather delaying work in the
  building industry.
he said this explained the increase in the
  adjusted statistics.
total vacancies available rose by 1,900 to 26,300 at

petrochemical industry
  cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened u.s.
  dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will
  propel the streamlined u.s. petrochemical industry to record
  profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990,
  major company executives predicted.
this bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an
  industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted gaf
  corp &lt;gaf>, privately-held cain chemical inc, and other firms
  to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.
oil companies such as ashland oil inc &lt;ash>, the
  kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for
  money-making petrochemical businesses to buy.
"i see us poised at the threshold of a golden period," said
  paul oreffice, chairman of giant dow chemical co &lt;dow>, adding,
  "there's no major plant capacity being added around the world
  now.
the whole game is bringing out new products and improving
  the old ones."
analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,
  automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of
  paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.
u.s. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about
  90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike
  product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said john dosher,
  managing director of pace consultants inc of houston.
demand
  for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up
  by as much as 300 pct, he said.
oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in
  houston, said dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned
  last year and predicted it would have the best year in its
  history.
in 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel
  and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong u.s.
  dollar, dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs.
"i believe the entire
  chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,"
  oreffice said.
gaf chairman samuel heyman estimated that the u.s. chemical
  industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.
last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion
  dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.
the turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical
  industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and
  planning, said pace's john dosher.
dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks
  dramatically cheaper and at the same time the american dollar
  was weakening against foreign currencies.
that helped boost
  u.s. chemical exports.
also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has
  been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical
  manufacturing capacity created by middle eastern oil producers
  in the early 1980s.
finally, virtually all major u.s. chemical manufacturers
  have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program
  to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate
  unrelated businesses.
the restructuring touched off a flurry of
  friendly and hostile takeover attempts.
gaf, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire
  union carbide corp &lt;uk>, recently offered three billion dlrs
  for borg warner corp &lt;bor>, a chicago manufacturer of plastics
  and chemicals.
another industry powerhouse, w.r. grace &lt;gra> 
  has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer
  businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.
but some experts worry that the chemical industry may be
  headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on
  the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as
  ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that
  are custom-designed for a small group of buyers.
"companies like dupont &lt;dd> and monsanto co &lt;mtc> spent the
  past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity
  chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had
  deteriorated," dosher said.
"but i think they will eventually
  kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche
  market."
some top chemical executives share the concern.
"the challenge for our industry is to keep from getting
  carried away and repeating past mistakes," gaf's heyman
  cautioned.
"the shift from commodity chemicals may be
  ill-advised.
specialty businesses do not stay special long."
houston-based cain chemical, created this month by the
  sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700
  mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.
chairman gordon cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout
  of dupont's conoco inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1
  billion dlrs since january to buy seven petrochemical plants
  along the texas gulf coast.
the plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that
  are the building blocks of specialty products.
"this kind of commodity chemical business will never be a
  glamorous, high-margin business," cain said, adding that demand
  is expected to grow by about three pct annually.
garo armen, an analyst with dean witter reynolds, said
  chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for
  plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood
  and steel products.
armen estimated the upturn in the chemical
  business could last as long as four or five years, provided the
  u.s. economy continues its modest rate of growth.

dominion calls burlington &lt;bur> report rumor
  &lt;dominion textile inc> considers a
  published report that it has bought a stake in burlington
  industries inc and is considering making a joint bid for the
  company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said.
"as far as i am concerned and the company is concerned, they
  are rumors and we're not commenting on rumors," spokesman michel
  dufour told reuters in response to a query.
"all the information that has been given out publicly is
  that, yes, dominion textile is interested in making an
  acquisition that big...probably based on that people are
  starting all sorts of rumors," he said.
dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a
  rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment
  further.
dominion textile president and chairman thomas bell
  was out of town and unavailable for comment.
dominion textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln-
  u.s.-dlr bid for avondale mills and has maintained a 120-mln-
  u.s.-dlr line of credit to be used for an american acquisition.
dufour said the company has been negotiating with "many"
  u.s. textile companies but would not say whether burlington
  industries was one of them.
burlington's stock rose sharply this morning on the report,
  which said dominion textile had joined with u.s. investor asher
  edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a
  takeover offer.
dominion textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1
  mln canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has
  repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the u.s.
the company has said it plans to diversify into new product
  and market areas in addition to expanding its textile
  operations.

cocoa exporters expected to limit sales
  major cocoa exporters are likely to
  limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world
  prices, sources close to a meeting of the cocoa producers
  alliance (cpa) said.
the sources said the depressed world market had been one of
  the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the
  11-member cpa which began on monday.
they said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the
  buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his
  effort to support prices.
major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed
  operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in london
  last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the
  market soon.
prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa
  surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has
  to buy cocoa under stock rules.
the buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range
  by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise.
"the world's cocoa price at present is just not interesting,"
  commented one delegate representing a major cpa producer.
another source said that with much of the 1986/87
  (october-september) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in
  the near term concerns essentially next year's harvest.
the sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in
  brazil, the world's number two producer, is in private hands.
this means limiting sales is more difficult than in major west
  african producers, where sales are made or authorized by
  commodity marketing boards.
the cpa includes the world's top three producers, ivory
  coast, brazil and ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output.
the meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening.

j.p. morgan &lt;jpm> net hurt by brazil, trading
  j.p. morgan and co inc said its
  first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its
  previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status
  its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to brazil.
that decision, spurred by brazil's suspension of interest
  payments on february 20, reduced the quarter's net income by 20
  mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the
  first three months of 1986.
morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities
  underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln
  dlrs in the year-earlier period.
in the fourth quarter of 1986, morgan posted other trading
  losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and
  underwriting of euromarket securities.
conditions in some sectors of the euromarket remained
  difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering
  heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether
  morgan's trading losses were restricted to the euromarket.
on the positive side, morgan reduced its provision for loan
  losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier.
foreign
  exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and
  trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln.
morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and
  commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net
  investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.
net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first
  quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell
  to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct.
if brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means
  that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are
  actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9
  mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct.
if brazil does not resume
  payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, morgan added.
after the provision for loan losses, morgan's allowance for
  credit losses at the end of march totaled 953 mln dlrs compared
  with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.
it reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after
  charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49
  mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.
excluding brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were
  583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year
  earlier.
non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from
  303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to
  personnel costs, morgan said.

brazil grain harvest faces storage problems
  storage problems with brazil's record
  grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln
  tonnes, an agriculture ministry spokesman said.
ministry spokesman leonardo brito, speaking from brasilia,
  told reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this
  year's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.
he said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in
  harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage
  problems.
brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes,
  theoretically sufficient for the crop.
but brito said that the storage capacity was badly
  distributed.
the states of sao paulo, parana and rio grande do
  sul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but were
  responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.
the biggest problems are concentrated in the centre-west
  growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage
  capacity.
brito said the centre-west, whose crops include soya and
  maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grains
  production but only 20 pct of its storage space.
in addition to the poor distribution of storage units,
  there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to
  storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for
  storing loose grain, brito said.
finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the
  crops.
the sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop
  has been evident from television reports, which have shown
  enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.
fleet &lt;flt> shareholders approve share increase
  fleet financial group said its
  shareholders approved an increase in shares of the company's

j. terence murray, chairman and president of fleet
  financial, said, "fleet's mortgage banking activities in

reuters chairman urges freer information flows
  exchanges and telecommunications
  authorities should abolish their restrictions on full and free
  dissemination of information to the investment and banking
  communities, reuters holdings plc &lt;rtrs.l> chairman sir
  christopher hogg said.
in the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiations
  had brought agreement with the tokyo and london stock exchanges
  for fuller, but still not complete, access to market data
  through reuter services.
"many other markets maintain restrictions," he added.
hogg said members of some markets appear to believe that
  information restrictions protected their interests.
in other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting the
  distribution of data in order to provide competitive advantage
  to their own commercial information businesses.
he also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in the
  telecommunications field, some countries continue to protect
  their state monopolies at the expense of other economic
  sectors.
"reuter dealing services remain excluded from such
  countries.
as a result, banking communities serving entire
  economies are put at a competitive disadvantage," he added.
reuters increased its 1986 pre-tax profit by 39 pct from
  the previous year to 130.1 mln stg on a 43 pct rise in revenues

paris group publishing daily franc tin price
  the association of white metals has
  decided to publish a daily tin price here in french francs per
  100 kilos, the french federation of non-ferrous metals said.
the price, quoted for the first time yesterday, was
  introduced as the lack of tin quotes was causing problems for
  some french companies, a spokesman for the non-ferrous metals
  association said.
today's price was set at 4,776 francs per 100 kilos and
  tuesday's at 4,790.
the international chamber of commerce stopped publishing a
  tin price after the london metal exchange (lme) stopped tin
  trading on october 24, 1985.
the association has tested the basis it uses to calculate a
  french franc price over the last few months to ensure it was
  reliable, the spokesman said.
the french franc price is pre-tax, for specified quality, a
  minimum 99.9 pct purity, at a french port or border railway
  station and a minimum delivery of 10 tonnes.
the french federation of non-ferrous metals groups various
  metal associations including the association of white metals.

montedison's agrimont unit 1986 earnings
  &lt;montedison spa> of italy said net
  consolidated profit for its agrimont group, formed in june
  1986, totalled 1.5 billion lire in 1986.
agrimont spa, the holding company for montedison's
  agro-industrial businesses, had sales of 810 billion lire and a
  net profit of about 1.1 billion lire, after amortization costs
  of 35 billion lire and a 13 billion lire reduction in the value
  of inventory due to falling market prices, montedison said.
agrimont, still wholly owned by montedison, is taking steps
  to be traded on the milan exchange, the company said.
the company said that 1986 was characterized by an unstable
  fertlizer market due to the weak dollar and the decline of
  international prices for products sold in europe and the u.s
  where agrimont operates through its conserv division.
in pesticides and in animal health care products agrimont
  maintained its previous level of revenues and market share in
  1986, montedison said.
montedison said it named ettore dell'isola to the newly
  created position of president of agrimont.
montedison also said it named renato picco, managing

  within two years.

talking point/burlington industries &lt;bur>
  the largest u.s. textile maker focused
  on its own business as its competitors found merger partners,
  but now burlington industries inc may have restructured itself
  into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said.
the takeover spotlight fell today on burlington, which rose
  4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor asher edelman and
  dominion textiles inc of canada bought an almost five pct
  stake.
a published report said edelman and dominion jointly
  acquired a stake in burlington and were weighing a takeover
  offer.
edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for
  montreal-based dominion called the report just "rumors."
burlington said it did not know if the report was true.
wall street professionals said they were not convinced of
  the story or that edelman and dominion would be the victors if
  burlington actually came into play.
arbitragers said past comments from dominion, however,
  added credence to the speculation.
dominion has said that it
  was looking for a takeover in the u.s.
      last year, dominion unsuccessfully bid for avondale mills
  and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for
  a u.s. acquisition.
a dominion spokesman said canada's largest textile producer
  has been negotiating with "many" u.s. textile companies, but
  would not say whether burlington was among them.
"there have been acquisitions in this area.
it's not
  unusual that someone could be looking at burlington after the
  housecleaning they've done," said eileen gormley of thomson
  mckinnon.
burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets
  and other linens, to j.p. stevens and co inc for 110 mln dlrs
  last year.
it also has reorganized management, and focused its
  operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign
  competition, gormley said.
"they've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,"
  said gormley.
she said in moving more heavily into industrial
  fabrics, burlington bought c.h.
masland, which supplies carpets
  and other fabric to the auto industry.
"in the past, they just spent and never realized the return
  on the outlays they did make," she said.
"you look at their record over the year, and i think
  they're poised to be more profitable than they had been in the
  past," gormley said.
she estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up
  from 2.01 dlrs per share.
some analysts today recommended clients not buy burlington
  at its current levels.
edward johnson of johnson redbook said he recommends
  selling.
he said he believes the stock is worth only about 50
  dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings
  basis.
some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been
  placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.
"after asher's (edelman) recent history, a lot of people
  don't find him very credible anymore," said one arbitrager.
another, however, said edelman succeeds in forcing
  managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if
  he doesn't win the target company.
edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for lucky
  stores inc and fruehauf corp.
he did succeed in buying
  ponderosa inc.
the stocks of other textile makers rose along with
  burlington.

japan in last-ditch effort to avert tariffs
  senior japanese officials tomorrow
  open talks with american trade negotiators in a last-ditch
  effort to avert new high u.s. tariffs to be imposed on a wide
  variety of japanese electronic exports.
makoto kuroda, vice minister of japan's ministry of
  international trade and industry (miti), is to hold two days of
  meetings with the deputy u.s. trade representative, michael
  smith, and the under secretary of commerce, bruce smart.
the new tariffs, to go into effect on april 17, are in
  retaliation for japan's failure to adhere to an agreement to
  end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and
  to open its home market to u.s. semiconductor shipments.
they are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors,
  including television and audio equipment and computers.
both u.s. and japanese officials have said there was little
  likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct
  duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of japanese shipments.
president reagan announced the planned tariffs on march 27
  after he said that close monitoring of the july 1986
  u.s.-japanese semiconductor pact convinced u.s. officials that
  japan was not honoring the agreement.
in making the annoucement, reagan said "i am committed to
  the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to
  provide american industry with free and fair trade."
trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at japan's
  semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured
  the u.s. semiconductor industry, as congress, which has
  complained about presidential timidity on trade issues.
congressional democrats have pledged to enact aggressive
  trade laws to counter what they contend has been reagan's
  inaction to redress the growing u.s. trade deficit, which last
  year reached 169.8 billion dlrs.
about one-third of the deficit was with japan.
reagan said there were recent signs japan was beginning to
  adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it.
kuroda said on leaving tokyo today he had no new proposals
  but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation.
he told the daily newspaper ashai shimbun that reagan's
  decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense
  of miti's power to control japanese traders.
"the united states has excessive expectations.," he said.
to
  stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by
  excess inventories since 1985 will take some time."
he also said that u.s. firms had not been aggressive enough
  in trying to sell in the japanese market.
hoechst celanese sends report on new facilities
  &lt;hoechst celanese corp> said it
  sent propsective customers a confidential report describing its
  polyester textile fiber facilities in north carolina and south
  carolina.
the company did not disclose any prices.
the report describes the facilities in darlington county,
  s.c., and fayetteville, n.c., the company said.
the report also
  decribes related manufacturing, marketing, administrative and
  technical resources that could be made avialable to a buyer.
hoechst celanese was formed feb 27 by the merger of
  celanese corp and american hoechst corp.
the merger took place
  after an agreement was reached with the federal trade
  commission that certain domestic polyester textile fiber assets
  of the combined companies would be divested, it said.
hoechst celanese said it has the option of divesting either
  the south carolina facilities of the former american hoechst or
  a package of polyester textile fiber facilities of the former
  celanese.

a gec spokesman said that it is company policy not to

preston corp &lt;ptrk> sees first quarter loss

  the first quarter, compared with a profit of 1,081,000 dlrs or
  19 cts per share a year before.
the trucking company attributed the loss to the continued
  rate of discounted in its primary markets, flat revenues and
  increased costs, including uninsured claims expense resulting
  from adverse weather conditions during the last three months.
it said results outside the northeast were strong, and it
  expects to show improved results for the rest of the year.
white house standing firm on japanese sanctions
  presidential spokesman marlin
  fitzwater said u.s. trade sanctions against japan were likely

  japanese officials to avoid them.
"all indications are they will take effect," he said.
"i would say japan is applying the full court press ...
they
  certainly are putting both feet forward in terms of explaining
  their position," fitzwater told reporters.
he noted high level meetings on the trade dispute are
  underway here but said, "i don't think there's anything i can
  report and i don't believe there's been any official movement."

cocoa terminal deposits to be cut 25 pct - icch
  the basic deposit on cocoa futures
  contracts will be reduced by 25 pct as from friday, april 10,
  taking the required deposit for one 10 tonne lot to 300 stg
  from 400 previously, a spokesman for the international
  commodity clearing house (icch) said.
the deposit for spread contracts will be similarly cut, to
  150 stg for a one 10 tonne lot from 200 previously, he said.
the icch had been looking at cocoa market fluctuations over
  a period of weeks, he said, adding the market's basic stability
  had warranted a cut in deposit rates.
the decision to cut deposits was taken by the icch after
  consultation with the london cocoa terminal market, the
  spokesman said.
the cuts were likely to attract more business to the
  market, he said.

heineken sees higher profits, wider penetration
  dutch brewer heineken nv said it hoped
  to maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to
  the 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite
  continuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts
  to extend world penetration.
heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln
  guilders, after 265 mln in 1985.
chairman freddie heineken said the company, europe's
  leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986,
  said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.
the volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the u.s.,
  where the brand amstel lite saw great demand, and in europe,
  where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.
turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker
  foreign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.
further consolidation of foreign companies, including the
  increase of its stake in leading spanish brewery &lt;el aguila
  s.a.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly
  in french and spanish interests, eroded profit margins.
the
  company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in
  restructuring and marketing, heineken said.
heineken's spanish activities should start yielding profit
  next year, heineken said, adding that its french operations had
  already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.
vice chairman gerard van schaik said the decision by the
  european court of justice in luxembourg to allow foreign beer
  into the closed west german market -- europe's biggest beer
  market -- offered interesting possibilities for heineken.
"we
  have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important
  point," van schaik said, adding that since the ruling heineken
  had been inundated by german traders seeking joint ventures.
"the question is not if we want to penetrate the german
  market, but how we are to do it," van schaik said, adding that
  while the widely traveled germans seemed to be developing a
  taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very
  regionalized.
heineken board member hans coebergh, responsible for
  african operations, said he saw africa as one of the most
  important beer growth markets in the long term.
he said the company, present in africa since 1932 and with
  majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was
  hampered by the lack of hard currencies there.
africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters
  per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions
  and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total
  1986 sales.
on-site production is rendered expensive by the high price
  of imports of essential ingredients.
but heineken scientists
  have been looking at other possibilities.
to balance the costs of imported malt, heinken launched on
  the nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which
  had sold successfully, coebergh said.
heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw
  materials, but coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were
  popular in rwanda .
"this is a possibility, but we could not
  possibly achieve the heineken flavor," coebergh said.
chairman heineken said the company's seven year efforts to
  penetrate the soviet market had finally resulted this week in a
  contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.
but again, a lack of hard currencies limited heineken's
  market potential.
heineken now has seven bars in moscow that
  are enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western
  money.

colombia business asked to diversify from coffee
  a colombia government trade official has
  urged the business community to aggressively diversify its
  activities and stop relying so heavily on coffee.
samuel alberto yohai, director of the foreign trade
  institute, incomex, said private businessmen should not become
  what he called "mental hostages" to coffee, traditionally
  colombia's major export.
the national planning department forecast that in 1987
  coffee will account for only one-third of total exports, or
  about 1.5 billion dlrs, with oil and energy products making up
  another third and non-traditional exports the remainder.
turkey calls for dialogue to solve dispute
  turkey said today its disputes with
  greece, including rights on the continental shelf in the aegean
  sea, should be solved through negotiations.
a foreign ministry statement said the latest crisis between
  the two nato members stemmed from the continental shelf dispute
  and an agreement on this issue would effect the security,
  economy and other rights of both countries.
"as the issue is basicly political, a solution can only be
  found by bilateral negotiations," the statement said.
greece has
  repeatedly said the issue was legal and could be solved at the
  international court of justice.
the two countries approached armed confrontation last month
  after greece announced it planned oil exploration work in the
  aegean and turkey said it would also search for oil.
a face-off was averted when turkey confined its research to
  territorrial waters.
"the latest crises created an historic
  opportunity to solve the disputes between the two countries,"
  the foreign ministry statement said.
turkey's ambassador in athens, nazmi akiman, was due to
  meet prime minister andreas papandreou today for the greek
  reply to a message sent last week by turkish prime minister
  turgut ozal.
the contents of the message were not disclosed.

gatt official meets with u.s. farm leaders
  the official in charge of
  agricultural matters in the new round of global trade talks is
  in washington today and tomorrow to meet with congressional and
  reagan administration officials.
aart de zeeuw, chairman of the general agreement on tariffs
  and trade's negotiating group on agriculture, met this morning
  with members of the house agriculture committee.
committee sources said de zeeuw expressed concern over
  protectionism and high farm price supports.
house lawmakers
  noted that in 1985 the united states took steps to reduce loan
  rates, committee staff said.
"members told him (de zeeuw) that we lowered our (u.s.) loan
  rates and can't eliminate subsidies unilaterally," one source

j.p. morgan&lt;jpm> says dlr may prevent fed easing
  the relatively high level of real u.s.
  interest rates suggests that there is scope for further
  declines in money market rates, but the federal reserve is
  unlikely to promote such a drop as long as the dollar remains
  volatile, said j.p. morgan and co inc chairman lewis preston.
he said in response to a reporter's question after the
  bank's annual meeting that money market rates could decline
  further but, "i don't think the fed is going to encourage that
  as long as the exchange markets are as volatile as they are."
on the other hand, he said that, barring a collapse of the
  dollar, he did not see rates going much higher.
he said that morgan's recent rise in its prime lending rate
  was "purely a reflection of an increase in a whole spectrum of
  rates."
preston reiterated earlier company forecasts that the u.s.
  economy should show roughly 2.5 to three pct real growth this
  year.
he also said that as a consequence of the dollar's decline
  and oil price rises, inflation would rise "moderately" to a 3.5
  to four pct rate in 1987.
medtronic &lt;mdt> sees 15 pct earnings growth
  medtronic inc said it sees 15 pct
  growth in sales and earnings for the year ending april 30,
  1988.
at an analysts meeting here the company said that for the
  year ending april 30, 1987 it will earn about 73 mln dlrs, or
  about 5.15-5.35 dlrs a share on sales of about 500 mln dlrs.
in the year ago period, the company earned 53.4 mln dlrs,
  or 3.65 dlrs a share, on sales of 402.8 mln dlrs.
winston wallin, medtronic chairman, said the company will
  improve market share in fiscal 1988 in cardiac pacemakers and
  expand its cardiovascular therapeutic product line.
wallin cautioned analysts not to quickly change their per
  share estimates for the company as he said medtronic will have
  heavy sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 1988.
he said the company intends to reinvest its earnings in its
  businesses and not in its dividends.
"shareholders are better
  off if we grow the business rather than reinvest in dividends
  or share repurchases," he said.
wallin said he sees medtronic's share of the total
  worldwide pacemaker market increasing to 42 pct in fiscal 1988,
  from 40 pct in fiscal 1987.
he said the worldwide market for cardiovascualr therapeutic
  products, which includes pacemakers, valves, catheters and
  lasers, will be valued at about 2.5 billion dlrs 1990 and will
  double that by 1995.
wallin said, "our objective is to get a hold of new
  products and start building market share if we have to beg,
  borrow or steal to get into new markets."
in the past, medtronic's pacemakers have been plagued with
  a number of problems leading to product recalls.
regulators
  also have criticized the industry, citing quality problems and
  a needless overprescription of pacemakers.
"we have no knowledge of any major problems in our
  pacemakers or leads," wallin said.
"we intend to re-establish
  our company as the quality leader in the industry."
glen nelson, executive vice president for medtronics, said
  the company intends to diversify internally and through
  acquisitions of companies in areas of medtronic's expertise,
  such as drug delivery systems.
wallin said the 15 pct earnings growth for fiscal 1988 does
  not include dilutions from acquisitions.
"we hope to have some
  safety provisions so that we won't have any major dilutions
  from an acquisition."
wallin also said the company will have virtual exclusivity
  in rate responsive pacemakers for all of fiscal 1988.
the company markets activitrax, the first single chamber
  pacemaker that varies heartrate in response to physical
  activity.
siemens ag, a west german company, is also developing a
  rate responsive pacemaker.
spie batignolles could increase comstock holding

spie batignolles, a subsidiary of schneider sa &lt;schn.pa>,
  said in a statement it was negotiating to invest 20 mln dlrs in
  comstock in the form of bonds convertible into shares.
spie batignolles has held a 20 pct stake in comstock since
  february 1986.
a spokesman said if spie batignolles converted
  all the new bonds, it could open the way for the french company
  to take control of comstock but he gave no other details.
talks continue on tin agreement extension
  discussions on the possible extension of
  the sixth international tin agreement (ita) began at the
  quarterly session of the international tin council (itc) but
  the council is still waiting for decisions from various member
  states.
a number of producer governments in particular have not
  decided their final position on whether the ita should be
  extended for up to two years or wound down after it expires on
  june 30, according to delegate sources.
earlier today european community (ec) members decided to
  back an extension, with the exception of britain, which
  undertook to communicate its decision to its ec partners later.
delegates said it could be friday before all the member
  countries declare their positions on the possible extension.
today's full council session started shortly before 1500 gmt
  after the scheduled 1330 start was delayed by an ec
  coordination meeting.
the council reconvenes at 0930 gmt tomorrow, although
  delegates said the morning is likely to be taken up with minor
  technical matters and the main issue will probably not be
  discussed before the afternoon session.
pakistan cotton crop seen record 7.6 mln bales
  pakistan is likely to produce a record
  7.6 mln bales (375 lbs each) of cotton from the current 1986/87
  crop, exceeding a target of 7.2 mln bales, food and agriculture
  minister mohammad ibrahim baluch said.
he told a pakistan central cotton committee meeting here
  the present was the third consecutive poroduction
  record-setting year and said the momentum would be accelerated
  in the future, the official app news agency reported.
baluch said indications were that pakistan is to attain a
  record cotton production of 7.6 mln bales, compared to the
  1985/86 crop of 7.2 mln bales which also represented the target
  earlier set by authorities for this year's production.

white house says japanese tarriffs likely
  the white house said high u.s.
  tariffs on japanese electronic goods would likely be imposed as
  scheduled on april 17, despite an all-out effort by japan to
  avoid them.
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater made the remark one
  day before u.s. and japanese officials are to meet under the
  emergency provisions of a july 1986 semiconductor pact to
  discuss trade and the punitive tariffs.
fitzwater said: "i would say japan is applying the
  full-court press...they certainly are putting both feet forward
  in terms of explaining their position."
but he added that "all
  indications are they (the tariffs) will take effect."
showboat &lt;sbo> to take charge, sees 3rd qtr loss
  showboat inc will take a
  charge of 19 to 20 mln dlrs pretax against results for the
  third quarter ended march 31, director and assistant to the
  president j. kell houssels iii told reuters.
he said the charge results from pre-operating expenses of
  its recently-opened atlantic city, n.j., showboat hotel, casino
  and bowling center and will cause a loss for the third quarter
  and probably for all of fiscal 1987 as well.
but houssels said showboat's earnings for fiscal 1988
  should show a sharp increase from fiscal 1986 levels due to the
  contribution of the new atlantic city facility.
showboat earned 1,753,000 dlrs in last year's third
  quarter.
for all of fiscal 1986 it earned 5,769,000 dlrs.
houssels said showboat since the opening of the atlantic
  city hotel/casino, showboat has had to start charging interest
  expenses connected with debt it sold to finance the facility
  directly against income rather than capitalizing the interest
  as it had been able to do previously.
showboat opened the hotel during its third quarter and
  gaming began last thursday on a regular basis after test gaming
  was completed earlier in the week.
security pacific &lt;spc> loans put on non-accrual
  security pacific corp said it is
  placing medium and long-term loans to brazil and ecuador on a
  non-accrual basis as of march 31, a move that will reduce first
  quarter earnings by 7.2 mln dlrs, or nine cts per share, after
  taxes.
despite the anticipated reduction to quarterly earnings,
  security pacific said it still expects to report first quarter
  earnings higher than the 88 mln dlrs, or 1.11 dlrs per share
  reported for the first quarter of 1986.
the bank holding company said the action affects 401 mln
  dlrs of loans to brazil and 73 mln of loans to ecuador.
brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs
  of medium- and long-term debt on february 20.
ecuador, which has foreign debt of roughly eight billion
  dlrs, has not paid any interest to foreign banks since
  february.
in march ecuador said it would suspend interest payments
  for the rest of the year because of an earthquake which halted
  the export of oil, which accounts for about 75 pct the
  country's export revenues.
in its announcement, security pacific said it will record
  interest income only as it is received in cash.
the company also said it believes that brazil will reach an
  agreement with its banks and that interest payments will resume
  later in 1987.
the brazilian negotiations resume on friday in new york
  when central bank governor francisco gros is expected to ask
  banks for a 90-day roll-over of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term
  debt that matures on april 15.
iraqi troops reported pushing back iranians
  iraq said today its troops were pushing
  iranian forces out of positions they had initially occupied
  when they launched a new offensive near the southern port of
  basra early yesterday.
a high command communique said iraqi troops had won a
  significant victory and were continuing to advance.
iraq said it had foiled a three-pronged thrust some 10 km
  (six miles) from basra, but admitted the iranians had occupied
  ground held by the mohammed al-qassem unit, one of three
  divisions attacked.
the communique said iranian revolutionary guards were under
  assault from warplanes, helicopter gunships, heavy artillery
  and tanks.
"our forces are continuing their advance until they purge
  the last foothold" occupied by the iranians, it said.
(iran said its troops had killed or wounded more than 4,000
  iraqis and were stabilising their new positions.)
the baghdad communique said iraqi planes also destroyed oil
  installations at iran's southwestern ahvaz field during a raid
  today.
it denied an iranian report that an iraqi jet was shot
  down.
iraq also reported a naval battle at the northern tip of
  the gulf.
iraqi naval units and forces defending an offshore
  terminal sank six iranian out of 28 iranian boats attempting to
  attack an offshore terminal, the communique said.

usda to propose foreign meat inspection rule
  the u.s. agriculture department is
  preparing a proposal that would require all foreign meat
  products to be inspected at their point of arrival in the
  united states, a usda official said.
donald houston, administrator of usda's food safety and
  inspection service, fsis, told a house agriculture subcommittee
  usda was developing a proposed change in regulations that would
  put an end to the current practice of permitting foreign meat
  products to be unloaded at one port and inspected at another
  port.
houston said the requirement would be phased in over
  several years to "avoid disruptions and economic hardship."
union texas oil reserves dropped in 1986
  union texas petroleum said its worldwide
  proved reserves fell to 511 mln barrels of oil equivalent at
  the end of 1986 from 555 mln barrels reported in 1985.
in its newly released annual report, union texas said it
  replaced about 71 pct of its production of 56 mln barrels of
  oil equivalent last year after taking into account the sale of
  27 mln barrels of u.s. reserves.
union texas, the nation's largest independent oil and gas
  producer based on revenues, is a privately-held company owned
  by kohlberg kravis roberts and co and allied-signal inc &lt;ald>.
the houston-based company said it lost 57.5 mln dlrs on
  1.26 billion dlrs in sales last year, compared to profits of
  165 mln dlrs on 2.04 billion dlrs in sales in 1985.
union texas said it received an average of 13.35 dlrs per
  barrel for its international oil production and 2.99 dlrs per
  mcf for its foreign natural gas sales.
the majority of the
  company's total energy production is in the united kingdom,
  indonesia and pakistan.
in the united states, union texas said it completed
  evaluation work on its oil find in alaska's colville delta
  area.
"although significant oil reserves were confirmed,
  development of this discovery will not be economical without
  substantially higher prices," the company said.
union texas said it planned to spend about 42 mln dlrs over
  the next two years to develop its eugene island block 371 in
  the gulf of mexico.
in 1987, the company said it budgeted 178 mln dlrs for
  capital spending, less than half of the amount spent in 1985
  and down from 199 mln dlrs budgeted last year.
union texas also
  said it would seek acquisitions of oil and gas properties as
  well as petrochemical-related businesses.
ual &lt;ual> may respond to pilots today
  ual inc may have a response this
  afternoon to the pilots union proposal to buy its united
  airlines unit, a ual spokesman said.
"obviously, we have a lot of movement in our stock, and we
  need to get a clarification out," the spokesman said, adding
  that there was a "50-50" chance a statement would be released
  today.
the pilots earlier this week offered to buy the airline for
  2.3 billion dlrs, and assume 2.2 billion dlrs of existing debt.
takeover speculation has driven ual's stock for several
  weeks.
ual last month said new york real estate developer
  donald trump held a position in its stock, and that he also
  held discussions with its chairman.
the developer indicated in those talks that he took the
  position as an investment, but he revealed no other plans.
today, rumors circulated that coniston partners were buying
  ual stock.
ual jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2
  mln shares.
"united has got to consider this proposal.
i think the
  pilot's proposal is realistic.
i don't exptect them to take it,
  but it could put some interesting options in front of ual
  management," said timothy pettee, bear stearns and co analyst.
analysts have said ual made itself vulnerable to attack
  when it diversified away from its core airline.
it added hertz
  rental cars, westin and hilton international hotels in a
  strategy to become a travel service company.
the strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots union
  concerned that the company was not focussing enough attention
  on its airline.
ual has stood firm on its strategy.
it is emphasizing its
  new focus by changing its name to allegis, as of may one.
but takeover speculation has escalated, and wall street has
  been busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100
  dlrs per share.
traders today described the buying in ual as
  widespread, indicative to them that big institutions believe
  the stock is in play.
market sources have said that although trump attracted
  attention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as a
  catalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhaps
  throwing the company into the hands of another buyer.
"the first domino is you have an investor with a
  considerable stake.
the second domino is the union.
that type
  of attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past,"
  said pettee.
"what's interesting is the values are there.
there's
  something for everybody," he said.
hartmarx &lt;hmx> targets earnings growth
  hartmarx corp, following a year of
  restructuring, continues to target record earnings for fiscal
  1987, chairman john meinert told the annual meeting.
meinert reiterated an earlier comment that earnings for the
  remainder of the year must double the 1986 level to meet that
  goal.
in fiscal 1986, ended november 30, 1986, hartmarx
  reported earnings of 24.8 mln dlrs, or 1.20 dlrs a share, down
  from the prior year's 42.7 mln dlrs, or 2.25 dlrs a share.
the 110-year-old apparel manufacturer recently posted
  first-quarter earnings of 54 cts a share, up from 40 cts a year
  ago.
meinert told shareholders hartmarx has no plans to sell any
  of its divisions.
he added, "we have the financial capacity to
  take advantage of acquisitions."
in 1987, meinert said the company will open five new and 10
  redesigned kuppenheimer direct-to-consumer stores in atlanta,
  detroit, st. louis, washington, d.c. and san francisco.
he said the company's women's apparel continues to grow,
  and hartmarx has on the drawing board a briar concept store
  which will feature ties, shirts and some tailored clothing.

ghana to buy crude oil from iran
  ghana will import 15,000 tonnes of crude
  oil annually from iran under an agreement reached in tehran
  today, the iranian news agency irna reported.
the agency, received in london, said the accord was reached
  between iranian oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh and a visiting
  ghanaian delegation headed by foreign minister obed asamoah.
irna said that under the agreement, iran will also provide
  technical and scientific assistance in manpower training and
  oil exploitation, production and refining.
fed's heller says monetary growth to be slower
  robert heller, a member of the
  federal reserve board, said he expects "more modest levels" of
  growth in the money supply this year.
"in my view, this would not only be a logical, but also a
  most desireable development," he said in a speech prepared for
  delivery to an economic forum at chapman college in orange,
  calif.
      a text was released in washington.
he said the effect of lower inflation and financial
  deregulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished.
"consequently, monetary growth may return to more modest
  levels," heller said.
he noted growth in the money supply slowed
  after mid-january.
"i would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregates
  were to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year as
  well," he added.
heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation.
"the pricing behavior of american producers in response to
  price increases of their foreign competitors will be crucial
  for our economic future," he said.
widespread domestic price rises in response to rising
  import prices would "generalize the inflationary forces
  emanating from the foreign trade sector" and might not gain more
  market share for u.s. producers.
"a return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well be
  the result of such a behavior pattern," heller warned.
he said "we at the federal reserve will have to be
  disciplined in our conduct of monetary policy."
heller said said the government should also exercise fiscal
  discipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint rather
  than new taxes.
"the imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindle
  inflation and certainly would not make us more competitive in
  international markets," heller said.
he said the u.s. economy should expand by nearly three pct
  during 1987, aided by higher exports to europe and canada.
a free trade agreement currently being negotiated with
  canada "would be exceedingly helpful in allowing american
  producers to compete more effectively in that country," heller
  said.

industrial nations reconvene for talks
  financial ministers and central
  bankers of leading industrial nations reconvened here this
  afternoon.
canadian finance minister michael wilson said on entering
  the meeting the ministers would review the paris agreement.
asked if he was satisfied with west german and japanese
  stimulus, wilson replied, "they could do a little more."
french finance minister edouard balladur, meanwhile,
  confirmed there would be a communique at the end of the
  meeting.
finance ministers and central bankers of britain, france,
  canada and west germany were seen by reuter correspondents
  returning to a treasury building.
japanese officials and bundesbank president karl otto poehl
  did not appear to have left the building at the end of earlier
  group of five talks which broke up around 2 p.m. local time
  (1800 gmt).
there was no sign, however, of the italian delegation whose
  position was thrown into question this morning by the
  resignation of the christian democratic wing of italy's
  socialist-led government.
european monetary officials said later that the italian
  delegation was inside the building.
this meant that a full blown meeting of the group of seven
  was in progress.
u.s. meat, poultry inspection called faulty
  the u.s. meat and poultry inspection
  programs are incapable of protecting consumers from
  contaminated products, groups representing inspectors and
  consumers charged.
"the whole trend of inspection for the last 10 years has
  been to corrupt and to degrade the system where today the
  public is at constant risk to contaminated and adulterated
  meat," kenneth blaylock, president of the american federation of
  government employees, told a house agriculture subcommittee.
"the american consumer has little reason to feel confident
  about the safety of meat and poultry being offered to him
  today," said rodney leonard, executive director of the community
  nutrition institute.
"company management is less concerned about the risk to
  health than about raising plant output and company profits,"
  leonard told a hearing of the house agriculture subcommittee on
  livestock, dairy and poultry.
kenneth morrison, staff associate at the government
  accountability project, said inspectors consistently disclose
  violations of federal law, demonstrating a "serious breakdown in
  the entire inspection system."
morrison told of chicken fat for flavoring being
  contaminated by "intestines dragging in a water trough used to
  flush away the condemned product, fecal material, human spit,
  chewing gum and paper towels used by plant employees to blow
  their noses."
donald houston, administrator of the u.s. agriculture
  department's food safety and inspection service, fsis, defended
  the government's program, calling it "one of the most respected
  public health programs in the world."
fsis inspects an estimated 127 mln head of cattle and 4.5
  billion chicken and turkeys every year.
houston said inspection programs have kept pace with
  change, but conceded that the danger of chemical residues in
  the meat and poultry supply has increased.
he also said that, although he was confident the bacterium
  salmonella eventually could be eradicated, it would take time
  and much money to contain the growing problem.
salmonella, which in extreme cases can cause death, is
  found in approximately 37 pct of u.s. broilers, 12 pct of raw
  pork and three to five pct of raw beef, houston said.
the number of reported cases has doubled over the past 20
  years, he said, to 40,000 cases annually.
"we certainly really have not found an effective means of
  turning this disease around," said rep. james olin (d-va.)
      the national research council recommended in 1985 that fsis
  intensify efforts to develop rapid diagnostic procedures for
  detecting microoganisms.
but the meat and poultry industries have said such controls
  would cost too much.
"hopefully we will not overreact by installing unnecessarily
  complicated procedures that may become obstacles to the real
  goal of providing an increasingly safer, more nutritious and
  economical meat supply for consumers," stanley emerling,
  executive vice president of the national association of meat
  purveyors, said.
blaylock, speaking on behalf of food inspectors, said a new

chrysler &lt;c> renault delay am motors &lt;amo> pact
  chrysler corp and regie natiionale des
  usines renault said they agreed to extend by up to two weeks
  the period for reaching definitive agreement on chrysler's
  proposed 1.5 billion dlr takeover of american motors corp.
the letter of intent signed by chrysler and renault on
  march nine set april nine as the target date for completing
  negotiations.
however, the letter also allowed room for an extension of
  that date to april 23 if an agreement could not be reached.
the two companies said they "now plan to complete work by
  april 23."
chrysler and renault said, "given the complex nature of the
  deal, the need for additional time was to be expected."
the march letter of intent between the two companies says
  that chrysler could ask renault to extend the agreement date
  "in the event that prior to april 9, 1987, chrysler discovers
  an unforeseen problem in the course of its 'due diligence'
  investigation of the company," referring to american motors.
a chrysler spokeswoman would not say whether some problem
  had cropped up in the talks.
she stuck by the company's
  statement that more time was needed because the talks are
  complex.
"that is our definition of the delay," she said.
under the previous agreement between chrysler and renault,
  their letter of intent would be terminated on april nine or
  when an agreement was reached.
but the letter could be amendend
  by a written agreement by both companies.
the chrysler spokeswoman said, "we are still working toward
  a definitive agreement."
said another chrysler official who is
  not part of the talks but who would be told if the deal were in
  trouble: "there are no glitches."
analysts also downplayed the significance of the delay.
"i
  can't visualize where they wouldn't want it to be done," said
  donaldson lufkin jenrette analyst richard henderson.

general electric &lt;ge> 1st qtr helped by rca
  general electric corp said its
  first quarter results were significantly higher due to the
  strong results of rca, which was acquired last year.
general electric also attibuted continued strong
  performances in plastics, major appliances and the employers
  reinsurance corp for its strong quarter.
ge recorded net earnings for the first quarter 1987 of 624
  mln dlrs, or 1.37 dls per shr, up 16 pct from 537 mln dlrs, or
  1.18 dlrs per share for the same quarter a year ago.
general electric chairman john welch jr reiterated the
  company's outlook for 1987 in which it expects double-digit ge
  earnings growth for the year.
he said the first quarter results
  are in line with those expectations.
general electric cited the strong results in tv network and
  station operations of the national broadcasting co, which was
  not part of ge in the first quarter of 1986, as one reason for
  its strong earnings.
it also noted that aircraft engine operating profit was
  much higher than a year ago, caused by a increase in shipments
  than the 1986 quarter, which was impacted by a strike.
aerospace revenues were sharply higher in this year's first
  quarter from a year ago, mainly because of the inclusion of
  rca's aerospace and defense business, the company said.
in addition, consumer products revenues were up from last
  year, mainly because of including sales of rca video products.
general electric said restructuring provisions of 308 mln
  dlrs before taxes to implement various strategic moves were
  charged against operations in the first quarter of 1987.
it
  added that there was a one-time gain of 281 mlns dlrs after
  taxes from an inventory accounting change.
and technical products revenues and operating profit were
  ahead of last year, led by a strong increases in medical
  systems volume and the inclusion this year of rca's
  communications and related services.
teck still in talks on b.c.
copper venture
  &lt;teck corp> said it
  was continuing talks about joining a joint copper venture at
  highland valley, british columbia, held by affiliates cominco
  ltd &lt;clt> and &lt;lornex mining corp>, but did not know when
  negotiations would be completed.
teck vice-president of administration john guminski said in
  reply to a query that the talks had been "ongoing for a long
  time."
he declined to speculate on the outcome.
cominco, 29.5 pct owned by a consortium led by teck, is
  optimistic that the talks will soon be concluded, spokesman don
  townson told reuters.
"i think all partners are hopeful that the situation will be
  resolved," cominco's townson said.
"we're optimistic that they will be concluded shortly," he
  added.
townson declined to specify when the talks might end.
cominco and teck's 22 pct-owned lornex agreed in january
  1986 to form the joint venture, merging their highland valley
  copper operations.
cominco and lornex share equally in control and management
  of the highland valley operations, while cominco has a 55 pct
  share of production and lornex receives 45 pct.
for the six months following july 1, 1986, when the venture
  officially started production, highland valley had total ore
  milled of 22.6 mln short tons, grading an average of 0.41 pct
  copper, townson said.
cominco's share of production was 43,000 short tons of
  copper contained in concentrate, 1,200 short tons of molybdenum
  in concentrate, 340,000 ounces of silver and 800 ounces of
  gold, he said.
a consortium, 50 pct owned by teck and 25 pct each by mim

xebec &lt;xebc> to report 2nd qtr loss
  xebec corp said it expects to
  report a loss for its second quarter ended april three, due
  principally to a decline in sales to international business
  machines corp &lt;ibm>, the company's largest customer.
xebec also said it expects revenues to total about 23 mln
  dlrs.
the company reported a second quarter loss last year of 1.9
  mln dlrs, or 14 cts per share, on 23.9 mln in revenues.
xebec said ibm has historically accounted for about 50 pct
  of the company's revenues, but that total fell to 20 pct during
  the quarter just ended.
ibm had used xebec's hard disk drive controller products in
  the ibm pc/xt, a product which ibm is phasing out.
xebec said it intends to continue streamlining its
  operations in light of the loss of business.
the company also said it has already consolidated two of

  surplus assets to provide additional liquidity.
ccc accepts export bid for wheat flour to iraq
  the commodity credit corporation has
  accepted a bid for an export bonus to cover a sale of 12,500
  tonnes of wheat flour to iraq, the u.s. agriculture department
  said.
the bonus awarded was 113.0 dlrs per tonne and will be paid
  to peavey company in the form of commodities from ccc stocks.
the wheat flour is for delivery may 15-june 15, 1987, the
  department said.

the

  year to improve over 1986.
in remarks prepared for delivery to shareholders, president
  peter donis said caterpillar's targeted five pct cost reduction
  in 1987 "will be difficult to achieve because the weaker dollar
  has limited opportunities to obtain lower material costs."

south korea corn imports may increase - usda
  south korea's purchase of about 2.4
  mln tonnes of u.s. corn in the past six months -- close to
  double last year's total -- indicates that imports from the
  united states, as well as total imports are set for a dramatic
  jump, the u.s. agriculture department said.
in its world production and trade report, the department
  said total south korea corn imports for the 1986/87 season
  (oct-sept) are estimated at 4.3 mln tonnes, with about 3.4 mln
  tonnes from the united states.
during the 1985/86 season, imports totaled only 1.3 mln
  tonnes of u.s. corn out of a total of 3.6 mln tonnes.
ite appears the koreans are shifting back to u.s. corn in
  light of competitive u.s. prices and uncertain supplies from
  china, argentina and south africa, it said.
mexican cattle imports to be branded - usda
  all steers imported into the united
  states from mexico must now be branded with the letter m on the
  right jaw, the u.s. agriculture department said.
in its world production and trade report, the department
  said the branding is necessary to improve surveillance for
  bovine tuberculosis because it provides a permanent way to
  identify mexican steers.
the requirement is not expected to affect the number of
  mexican steers imported into the united states and the brand
  will be applied before the animals arrive at u.s. ports of
  entry.
last november, the mexican government authorized an export
  quota of nearly 1.1 mln head of live cattle for the 1986/87
  season (aug-july), most of which goes to the united states.

usda seeks comments on grain discount schedule
  the u.s. agriculture department is
  seeking public comments on the question of adjusting the
  commodity credit corporation's (ccc) discount and premium
  schedules to improve the quality of grain it accepts as loan
  collateral or under price support programs.
the premiums and discounts schedule are based on quality
  factors such as moisture content and kernel damage.
the
  schedule stipulates the premiums and discounts used for valuing
  grain the ccc accepts or purchases during the year.
the department said it is possible that producers could be
  encouraged to delivery higher quality grain to ccc by adjusting
  the premiums and discounts.
comments are due by april 24 and a report to congress is
  required by law by may 10.

wojnilower sees drop in u.s. interest rates
  the federal reserve will promote lower
  interest rates this year to sustain world economic growth,
  first boston corp managing director albert wojnilower said.
as much as the fed would like to take a tough line against
  inflation, it cannot act to slow the growth of credit without
  subverting national u.s. economic policy.
"on selected occasions when the dollar seems steady, and,
  because the trade deficit is not responding, the united states
  decided to push germany and japan harder to meet their
  commitments to economic growth, the federal reserve will do its
  part by moving rates down," wojnilower said in a report.
"justifiably not anticipating either a recession or
  seriously higher interest rates, securities market participants
  have seen little to fear," wojnilower said.
he said last week's "hiccup" in money and currency rates
  and bond and stock prices was probably caused by japanese
  window dressing for march 31 end-of-fiscal-year accounts.
wojnilower said the u.s. probably enjoyed above-average
  economic growth in the first quarter.
however, the pick-up
  seems to reflect an unsustainable pace of inventory building
  and the prospect for the full year is still for real gross
  national product growth of about 2-1/2 pct, he said.

canada to monitor steel imports, exports
  canada plans to monitor steel shipments
  flowing in and out of the country in an attempt to appease
  concerns in the u.s. over the high level of canadian steel
  exports, trade minister pat carney said.
"to help maintain our open access to the u.s. steel market,
  the government is taking further action to ensure we have more
  accurate data on exports and imports and that canada is not
  used as a backdoor to the u.s. market by offshore suppliers,"
  carney said.
carney also said canadian companies were being asked to
  exercise prudence in the u.s. market and both countries were
  considering establishing a joint commission to study the
  growing steel problem.
carney told the house of commons she will soon announce an
  amendment to the exports and imports permits act to set up the
  monitoring program.
canadian steel shipments to the u.s. have risen to 5.7 pct
  cent of the u.s. market in recent months, almost double the
  level just two years ago, canadian trade officials said.
the increase in canadian shipments comes at a time of
  growing anger in the u.s. over rising steel imports from
  several countries in the face of a decline in the domestic
  steel industry.
some u.s. lawmakers have proposed canada's share of the
  american market be limited to 2.4 pct.

u.s.senate lifts some bans on natural gas
  the senate unanimously approved
  legislation to lift a ban on new construction of natural
  gas-fired power plants and other large industrial gas-burning
  plants.
the bill, sponsored by senate energy committee chairman
  bennett johnston, also repeals mandatory incremental pricing of
  natural gas which was designed to protect residential consumers
  from major price increases by forcing some industrial users to
  pay higher than market prices.
"this legislation will open up new natural gas markets," the
  lousiana democrat said.
the gas restrictions were enacted in 1978 in response to a
  shortage of natural gas and predictions of higher prices.
"now both oil and gas prices are severely depressed,"
  johnston said.
in a compromise with coal producers, the bill requires new
  baseload electric powerplants be designed to accomodate
  modifications necessary to burning coal or another alternate
  fuel.
southeast bancorp &lt;stb> acts on brazilian debt

based on current interest rates, it estimated in a filing
  that the move will reduce net income by about 800,000 dlrs in
  the first quarter and 3.2 mln dlrs for all of 1987.
the company
  also said it did not believe the brazilian debt situation would
  have a "material adverse" effect on it.
it also said it would issue 1,080,000 common shares in
  connection with its acquisition of popular bancshares corp.
williams &lt;wmb> sees flat pipeline volumes in 1987
  williams cos said it expected oil and
  fertilizer transportation volumes to be flat in 1987 but said
  operating profits from the pipeline unit should improve from
  49.4 mln dlrs earned last year when a seven mln dlr special
  charge was incurred.
williams pipeline co took the charge against earnings in
  1986 for the removal of more than 500 miles of old pipeline
  from service and for casualty losses.
companywide, williams had
  a net loss of 134 mln dlrs on total revenues of 1.85 billion
  dlrs, a decline from profits of 32 mln dlrs on sales of 2.46
  billion in 1985.
in its annual report, williams said its northwest pipeline
  corp and williams natural gas co had natural gas costs that are
  among the lowest in the nation, averaging 2.04 dlrs and 2.07
  dlrs per mcf, respectively, last year.
total natural gas
  reserves for both units declined to 10,010 billion cubic feet
  in 1986 from 11,334 billion cubic feet the previous year.
the company said its williams natural gas unit, which has
  less take-or-pay exposure than most major pipelines, should
  show improvement in its 1987 operating results because of
  changes tariff and federal tax rates.
the company's gas marketing business is expected to have
  somewhat lower earnings in 1987 because of competition in its
  operating region, the annual report said.
the gas marketing
  unit earned 26.0 mln dlrs on sales of 285.6 mln dlrs last year.
williams also said it expected a substantial decline in its
  debt to equity ratio this year because of more than 250 mln
  dlrs received in cash from the sale of agrico chemical co and
  proceeds from the sale and leaseback of williams
  telecommunications co.
the telecommunications business, a
  2,000-mile fiber optic system for long distance use, will not
  be profitable until late 1988, williams said.

coffee could drop to 70/80 cts, cardenas says
  international coffee prices could drop to

speaking at a forum for industrialists, he said one of the

hbo &lt;hboc> urges shareholders against andover

on march 30, andover group, a two-man general partnership
  which owns about seven pct of hbo's stock, filed preliminary
  proxy materials with the securities and exchange commission
  seeking to nominate an alternative slate of directors at the

andover had expressed an interest to acquire the company in
  september 1986 but hbo has never received an offer from them,
  it said.
in addition, hbo said its financial condition is improving
  rapidly as the result of a significant restructuring
  implemented in 1986.
it expects the company to report net income of about 40 cts
  per share in 1987 and a very significant increase in 1988.
for the year ended december 1986, the company reported a
  loss of 3.6 mln dlrs, or 16 cts per share.

hawkeye &lt;hwkb> 1986 annual report qualified
  hawkeye bancorp's 1986 annual
  financial results were qualified by its auditors, according to
  the annual report.
"...there are conditions which may indicate that the
  company will be unable to continue as a going concern,"
  auditors deloitte haskins and sells said in hawkeye's annual
  report to shareholders.
hawkeye reported a 1986 loss of almost 59 mln dlrs, citing
  an increase in its loan loss provision to 34.7 mln dlrs and
  restructuring costs of 27 mln dlrs.
however, hawkeye, with assets of 1.09 billion dlrs at 1986
  year end, said it expects "to have sufficient cash to meet its
  obligations for the next 12-month period."
last july the bank holding company reached a debt
  restructuring agreement which identifed 17 bank subsidiaries
  and five non-bank operations for disposition.
"the restructuring has improved hawkeye's financial
  condition, but it does not assure that hawkeye will be able to
  survive as a going concern," the report said.
hawkeye's survival will depend on its ability to comply
  with provisions of the debt restructuring and regulatory
  agreements and on its ability to return to profitable
  operations, it said.
there can be no assurance that hawkeye will be able to meet
  these requirements.
however, the company "believes it will be
  able to do so," hawkeye said.

dome &lt;dmp> plan may force sale of encor stake
  dome petroleum ltd's proposal to
  restructure debt of more than 6.10 billion canadian dlrs
  includes provisions that may force the company to sell its 42
  pct stake in &lt;encor energy corp inc>, dome said in a u.s.
  securities and exchange commission filing.
dome said in the filing that its debt plan proposes making
  payments under a five year income debenture to the lender whose
  debt is secured by dome's encor shares.
after the five years are up, "under certain circumstances
  the shares of encor may be required to be disposed," the company
  said.
dome has pledged its 42.5 mln encor shares as security for
  part of its debt to &lt;canadian imperial bank of commerce>,
  estimated last year at 947 mln dlrs.
analysts have said commerce bank was pressing dome to sell
  the stock to pay down its debt.
dome's encor shares had a market value of 313 mln dlrs on
  march 17, 1987, the company's filing said.
as previously reported, dome is seeking approval in
  principle for the debt restructuring plan.
dome said in the
  filing it proposed lenders sign a letter of understanding in
  early april, with implementation to be effective july 1, 1987.
dome petroleum reiterated in the sec filing that its
  existence as a going concern is dependent on continuing the
  interim debt plan, due to expire on june 30, and winning
  agreement for its proposed restructuring plan.
"the company believes that the negotiation and
  implementation of the proposed debt restructuring plan is
  realistic and achievable," dome said.
"however, the final outcome of the negotiations cannot be
  predicted at this time," it said.

deficit cuts seen unable to cure trade deficit
  financial analysts say they are
  pleased with congressional moves to trim next year's federal
  budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help
  improve the u.s. trade deficit or buoy the economy.
the house of representatives is expected to vote tomorrow
  to approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming
  fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs.
similarly, the senate budget committee has approved a plan
  that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next
  year.
"in terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs is
  infinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have little
  impact on the economy and the trade deficit," said stanley
  collander, a touche ross federal budget policy analyst.
"at best, it will have a small positive effect," collander
  said in an interview.
federal reserve board chairman paul volcker has repeatedly
  told congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way
  to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease
  some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar.
the u.s. government has attempted to remedy the trade
  imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar.
but volcker
  has warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraught
  with danger.
such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as
  imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign
  capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.
in addition, in february, u.s. officials meeting with other
  major industrialized nations in paris agreed that the value of
  the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates
  should be stabilized at around current levels.
as part of that agreement, japan and west germany agreed to
  take steps to stimulate their economies and the united states
  agreed to cut its budget deficit.
the alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a
  way to deal with the trade deficit, volcker said recently, is
  to reduce u.s. consumption, particularly federal spending.
"if you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything else
  you do is going to be counterproductive," volcker said in recent
  testimony before the senate banking committee.
volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the
  government's purse strings than have the fed tighten the credit
  supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or
  to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the united
  states.
analysts say that fed tightening now could choke off the
  current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.
kemper financial services economist john silvia stressed
  that any deficit reduction was better than none.
but he said the size of the cuts under consideration were 
  not enough to give the federal reserve board the flexibility it
  needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar
  from plunging further in world exchange markets.
"there's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if
  your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the
  fed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer
  is, it's not enough," silvia told reuters.
the u.s. trade deficit has become one of the government's
  most vexing and persistent problems.
the 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet
  little indication that this year's figure will be any lower,
  though administration officials have predicted it will drop by
  about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end.
in the past, volcker has joked that he never lost sleep
  worrying whether congress would cut too much fat from the
  federal budget.
on the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not
  attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for
  the 1986-1991 period by last year's gramm-rudman balanced
  budget law.
while the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for
  next year's federal deficit, both the house and senate budget
  committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall
  short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.
"for political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the
  most you're going to get" out of congress at the present time,
  said touche ross's collander.
"to do something more than that
  would be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult."
collander said the real danger for congress was to end up
  short of the deficit reduction goal set by its budget panels.
"to an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable
  reduction level," he explained.
"anything less than that will now
  look like a failure to wall street."
the budget plan now under debate on the house floor would
  lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year
  beginning on october one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting
  defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their
  anticipated spending levels for next year.
the senate budget committee has called for a deficit of
  nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new 
  taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.

colombia coffee registrations remain open
  colombia's coffee export registrations
  remain open and there are no plans to close them since a new

  gilberto arango, president of the private exporters'

"the philosophy of the new policy is not to close

nobody so far said may would be closed," he told

  average in recent years.
he estimated the amount of bags registered by the national

  of about 900,000 bags registered and sold per month by
  colombia.
"the only change that could happen is, because of the
  volume, we would be told that from such a date, registrations
  would be for june shipment, etc" arango said.

more american brands &lt;amb> acquisitions seen
  american brands inc's 545 mln dlrs
  acquisition of national distillers and chemical corp's liquor
  business is expected to be one of a series of acquisitions by
  the tobacco company, analysts said.
"they were very frustrated with their inability to get
  chesebrough.
they said they were looking for an acquisition.
it
  doesn't surprise me that they came up with another one," said
  allan kaplan of merrill lynch and co.
      american brands failed late last year in its 2.9 billion
  dlrs bid for chesebrough-ponds inc when unilever n.v. agreed to
  buy the company.
but since then, wall street has been
  speculating that american brands would find another candidate
  to help reduce its earnings exposure to tobacco.
"this is just typical," said george thompson of
  prudential-bache securities.
"there's going to be more to come
  here.
american brands had to make an acquisition because
  tobacco is still a significant part of earnings.
their position
  is a little less favorable than philip morris and rj reynolds,"
  he said.
cash flow from its low growth tobacco, but the tobacco business
  does require great amounts of capital expenditures.
it can
  therefore use its funds to make acquisitions.
analysts said the
  national distillers' spirits company, which makes gilbey's gin
  and vodka, old grandad and old crow whiskey, is not quite the
  type of acquisition they envisioned.
"the distilled spirits business has been in a steady
  gradual decline for sometime, as has the tobacco business,"
  said thompson.

bundesbank calls for central bank cooperation
  bundesbank board member claus koehler
  called on central banks of major industrialised nations to
  cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies.
in a lecture at the university of surrey, pre-released
  here, koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was
  protectionism and control on capital movements.
"central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market
  transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have
  them," he said.
he added that west german growth forecasts would
  have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop
  to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.
koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets
  had parted company with transactions in goods, services and
  investments.
it was the scale of speculative transactions that
  determined market trends.
speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to
  grow.
to reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates
  would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.
"in other words, the monetary policy measures required are
  different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --
  those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of
  mounting economic activity," koehler said.
the dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive u.s.
  current account deficit.
but attempts to keep the depreciation
  going by talking the dollar down posed problems.
the sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep
  rise in the cost of u.s. imports and a sharp fall in the cost
  of european imports.
but the volume effect of falling imports
  to the u.s. and rising imports to europe would take time to
  make itself felt compared with the price effect.
"hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going
  further than would be necessary to adjust the current account
  over the medium term," koehler said.
a reduction in the u.s. current account deficit would occur
  only if the growth rate of gnp was higher than domestic demand.
in japan and west germany by contrast, domestic demand should
  rise faster than gnp.
"in germany this did indeed happen in 1986," koehler said.
if a further appreciation of the dollar was to be
  prevented, the u.s. current account deficit could be offset by
  an inflow of foreign funds into the u.s..
but only if there was an appropriate interest rate
  differential would europe and japan look for financial
  investment in the u.s.
when selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank
  had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its
  measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.
koehler said the bundesbank was changing money market rates
  by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading
  interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market
  and its substantial impact on exchange rates.
it was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of
  price stability, economic growth and full employment but also
  to tackle international problems like the exchange rate
  problem, the debt problem and the current account problem.
a strategy had to be designed that helped "the safeguarding
  of non-inflationary economic growth in an international
  monetary system largely free of disruptions," koehler said.
given the system of floating exchange rates, it was
  necessary for central banks to agree to intervene.
it sufficed
  to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over
  the next few years and intervention points should not be set,
  because they were only testing points for the market, he said.
in order to keep the international monetary system free of
  disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but
  also cooperate on interest rate policies, koehler said.

japan ministry has no comment on rice talks report
  the agriculture ministry declined comment
  on a local newspaper report that japan had agreed to hold talks
  on its closed rice market in the new gatt round.
"we have no idea about the report and cannot comment," a
  spokesman told reuters.
nihon keizai shinbun, quoting unnamed government sources,
  said japan would tell u.s. agriculture secretary richard lyng
  and u.s. trade representative clayton yeutter of its
  intentions.
the two are due to visit japan later this month for
  farm talks.
the u.s. has been pressing japan to discuss the rice issue
  at the new round of general agreement on tariffs and trade
  talks.
but japan has said gatt is not the right forum.
imports of rice to japan are banned under the foodstuff
  control act.
nihon keizai said japan's plan resulted from worries about
  mounting trade tension with the u.s. at the gatt talks, japan
  will try to persuade the u.s. that its rice policy is
  justified, it said.
the 93-nation world trade body began the uruguay trade
  round last september.
it will take four years to negotiate.

economic spotlight - telecom is key japan ministry
  japan's little-known ministry of posts and
  telecommunications (mpt) has emerged as an international force
  to be reckoned with, political analysts said.
mpt, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the u.s.
  and britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of
  a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians,
  they said.
"the ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of
  a key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,"
  said one diplomatic source.
"they are a potent political force," the diplomatic source
  said.
but mpt is finding domestic political prowess does not
  always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts
  said.
"the ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not
  so internationalized," said waseda university professor mitsuru
  uchida.
"suddenly they're standing at the centre of the world
  community and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how to
  face the situation."
most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with
  london over efforts by britain's cable and wireless plc to keep
  a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in
  japan's lucrative overseas telephone business.
the ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival
  groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one
  competitor to kokusai denshin denwa co ltd, which now
  monopolizes the business.
it has also opposed a major management role in the planned
  merger for any non-japanese overseas telecommunications firm on
  the grounds that no such international precedent exists.
the ministry's stance has outraged both london, which has
  threatened to retaliate, and washington, which says the merger
  plan is evidence of japan's failure to honour pledges to open
  its telecommunications market.
washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it
  says have limited access for u.s. firms to japan's car
  telephone and satellite communications market.
much of mpt's new prominence stems from the growth of the
  sector it regulates.
"what has been happening is an important shift in the
  economy which makes the ministry a very important place," said
  james abegglen, head of the consulting firm asia advisory
  service inc.
      a decision to open the telecommunications industry to
  competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted
  rather than lessened mpt's authority, analysts said.
"with the legal framework eased, they became the de facto
  legal framework," said bache securities (japan) analyst darrell
  whitten.
close links with the powerful political faction of the
  ruling liberal democratic party (ldp) nurtured by former prime
  minister kakuei tanaka are another key to mpt's influence, the
  analysts said.
"other factions ignored mpt (in the 1970s), but the tanaka
  faction was forward looking and ...
recognized the importance
  of mpt," uchida said.
many former bureaucrats became members of
  the influential political group, he added.
the ministry also has power in the financial sector due to
  the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the
  postal savings system, analysts said.
mpt has helped block finance ministry plans to deregulate
  interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial
  liberalisation, since the change would remove the postal
  savings system's ability to offer slightly higher rates than
  banks, they said.
diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as mpt's
  obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized
  the ministry as feudal.
critics charge mpt with protecting its own turf, limiting
  competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its
  wing.
providing consumers with the best service at the lowest
  price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.
but many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of
  its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the western world
  including britain, several analysts said.
"the united states is really the odd man out," abegglen said.
"for a government to take the view that it wants to keep order
  in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable
  view," he said.
g-7 issues statement after meeting

german bankers' remarks revive talk of rate cut
  remarks by two leading central bankers
  sparked renewed speculation in financial markets that a cut in
  the west german three pct discount rate may be under
  discussion, currency dealers said.
bundesbank board member claus koehler said in a speech that
  monetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflows
  required cuts in interest rates.
separately, west berlin state central bank president dieter
  hiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall below
  its lowest ever point of 2.75 pct.
he made clear that he was
  not making a forecast on interest rates, however.
currency dealers here and in the far east said the dollar
  gained slight background support from the speculation.
but german dealers noted that the bundesbank kept the 3.80
  pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the money
  market this week, dashing some expectations that it may either
  offer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rate
  and let the strength of banks' demands set the allocation rate.
it allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much less
  than the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pact
  expired.
this further weakened sentiment the bundesbank could
  move to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said.
koehler said in a speech in surrey, england, speculative
  capital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless of
  whether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell.
"in other words, the monetary policy measures required are
  different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --
  those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of
  mounting economic activity."
though koehler was known to be the most liberal of the
  generally monetarist bundesbank board, his comments marked the
  first time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as a
  counterpoint to overly strong monetary growth, dealers said.

soviet trade deficit with west soars in 1986
  the soviet trade deficit with the west
  almost quadrupled last year, reaching 2.72 billion roubles
  compared with 713 mln in 1985, official figures showed.
statistics published by the monthly journal foreign trade
  showed soviet trade turnover for 1986 fell to 130.9 billion
  roubles from 142.1 billion the previous year, a drop of 7.8
  pct.
moscow's trade surplus with east bloc countries continued
  to grow in 1986.
western analysts attributed the deficit rise with the west
  to the world oil price slump, which hit moscow's main export
  and cut hard currency earnings needed for purchases in the
  west.

  the spread of wheat midges in 2.47 mln hectares in shanxi,
  henan, sichuan, anhui, hebei and jiangsu.

rtz sees rising u.s. output aiding 1987 results
  rio tinto-zinc corp plc &lt;rtzl.l>, rtz,
  said the predicted rise in industrial production in the u.s.
  and europe should boost its 1987 performance.
consumption of some base metals and their dlr prices are
  showing signs of improvement, although iron ore markets have
  weakened.
the oil price in u.s. dlrs is above the 1986 average,
  and if sustained, should improve energy earnings.
the company was commenting in a statement on its 1986
  results which, on a restated basis, showed net attributable
  profits lower at 245 mln stg after 257 mln the previous year.
pretax profits also dipped to 601.7 mln stg after 614.4 mln.
rtz said the excellent performance of its expanding range
  of industrial businesses in 1986 was offset by the collapse in
  oil prices.
industrial businesses contributed 202 mln stg to net
  profit, a 40 pct increase from 144 mln in 1985, and 60 pct of
  the total.
trading performance improved at wholly-owned
  subsidiaries rtz borax ltd, rtz cement ltd, rtz chemicals ltd
  and rtz pillar ltd. first time contributions from recent
  investment and acquisitions mainly in speciality chemicals and
  minerals also aided performance.
metals activities contributed 83 mln stg to net profit.

ec sugar tender seen marking no change in policy
  the maximum export rebate granted at
  yesterday's ec sugar tender marked no change in policy over
  producer complaints that they are not obtaining the ec
  intervention price in exporting sugar outside the community, ec
  commission sources said.
the maximum rebate was 46.496 ecus per 100 kilos for
  118,350 tonnes of sugar, down from 46.864 ecus the previous
  week, but the change is explained by world market conditions.
producers claim the rebate was short of the level needed to
  obtain a price equivalent to the intervention price by over one
  ecu per 100 kilos, and was 0.87 ecu short the previous week,
  the sources said.
they said this was despite the fact that the commission had
  to accept 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention from
  operators protesting that rebates are too low.
operators have now until early may to withdraw this sugar.
but they have not given any sign of planned withdrawals unless
  the commission reviews its export policy, they said.

japan business leaders say g-7 accord is worrying
  the leaders of two of japan's top business
  groups said in separate statements the group of seven (g-7)
  accord reached in washington yesterday is of deep concern to
  japan because it shows the major industrial nations regard the
  yen's current level as appropriate.
eishiro saito, chairman of the federation of economic
  organizations (keidanren), said the yen's present rate is well
  above adequate levels.
he did not elaborate.
takashi ishihara, chairman of the japan committee for
  economic development, said the accord will not prevent the yen
  from rising further.
"we do not understand why the g-7 approved present rates as
  the yen has risen excessively since the paris accord," ishihara
  said.
g-7 members britain, canada, france, italy, japan, the u.s.
  and west germany said in a statement they consider their
  currencies are now within ranges broadly consistent with
  economic fundamentals.
saito called on each g-7 member nation to prepare to
  intervene in the market strongly enough to ensure exchange
  rates are stabilised at appropriate levels.

philippine telephone firm plans stock split
  the philippine long distance telephone co
  &lt;pldt.mn> is planning a two-for-one stock split and a 20 pct
  stock dividend later this year to reduce excess market
  buoyancy, vice-president sennen lazo told reuters.
lazo said the stock split would reduce the par value of the
  company's common stock from 10 to five pesos.
he said the stock split would apply to holders of about 18
  mln common shares of stock on the record date of september 15
  1987.
"the exercise should make our stock more marketable," lazo
  said.
"now it is beyond the reach of many small investors."
pldt common stock surged from a low of 37 pesos in february
  1986 to 367.50 at close of trading yesterday on the manila
  stock exchange.
lazo said the 20 pct stock dividend, payable on october 15,
  would also apply to stockholders on record as of september 15.
pldt reported 1986 net income of 1.89 billion pesos, up 68
  pct from 778.9 mln pesos in 1985, on operating revenues of six
  billion pesos, up from 4.7 billion pesos in 1985.
at end december 1986 the company had 417,100 stockholders.
a pldt spokesman said the company's profits are likely to
  be substantial since the government raised its franchise tax to
  three pct from two and to impose a 35 pct corporate income tax
  from which it was previously exempt.
the government has not so far ordered the implementation of
  the tax decision.
pldt is the largest of 58 telephone companies in the
  philippines.
on december 31 1986 the company had 856,014
  telephones in operation, representing 94 pct of all instruments
  in the country.

malaysia seeks 42 billion yen pipeline loan
  malaysia has asked japan for a 42
  billion yen 25-year loan to finance the construction of gas
  pipelines from eastern trengganu to southern johor, the
  overseas economic cooperation fund (oecf) said.
oecf's chief representative, takashi matsuya, told
  reporters the japanese government is appraising the loan.
another oecf official told reuters japan is likely to approve
  the loan because "it is technically and economically viable."
if approved, the loan would carry a coupon rate of four
  pct, a grace period of seven years, matsuya said.
it would be
  disbursed over three years, he added.
the pipeline contruction is the second phase of the
  peninsular gas utilisation project by petronas, malaysia's

  credit commercial de france &lt;ccfp.pa>
  reported a parent company net profit up 34.8 pct to 140.1 mln
  francs from 103.9 mln francs a few weeks before its
  denationalisation around the end of this month.
official sources said the bank, france's sixth largest in
  terms of its deposits and seventh in terms of its assets,
  
  planned a share split to increase the number of shares on offer
  ahead of the sale of 40 pct of its ordinary share capital to
  the public, of 10 pct to staff and 20 pct abroad.
previously one of france's biggest private banks, it was
  nationalised by the socialists in 1982.
the sources said it was too early to give details of the
  planned split or of the share price, but cited april 27 as a
  likely date for the flotation launch.
so far 30 pct of the group's capital, currently at 10.33
  mln shares of 100 francs nominal, has been offered for sale to
  large private investors to constitute a solid core of eight to
  ten shareholders before the flotation.
the private tender offer closes on april 16, while a 12 mln
  franc advertising campaign for the flotation begins on sunday.
"the privatisation will be a way of attracting extra clients,"
  ccf deputy director-general rene de la serre told reuters.
market sources put the total value of ccf's privatisation
  at between four and five billion francs.
de la serre said the bank was likely to attract at least
  the same number of investors as &lt;sogenal>, another recently
  privatised bank in which 850,000 people bought shares.
the government's sweeping privatisation programme has also
  included the sale of saint-gobain &lt;sgep.pa>, and cie financiere
  de paribas &lt;pari.pa>.
the sale of &lt;banque du batiment et des
  travaux publics> and &lt;banque industrielle et mobiliere privee>

major rubber producers to meet in singapore
  officials from indonesia, malaysia,
  singapore and, perhaps, thailand will meet here tomorrow to
  discuss increased regional cooperation on rubber marketing and
  ways to raise rubber prices, industry sources said.
the officials will discuss linking rubber markets in the
  four countries to improve price transparency, the sources said.
this is the first time indonesia is attending such a
  meeting, they said, but representatives from thailand may not
  be able to attend because of their tight schedule.
malaysia,
  indonesia and thailand account for 90 pct of world rubber
  exports and singapore is a major regional rubber trading
  centre.
the malaysian rubber futures market, freighting and
  contracts for rubber are among other issues expected to be
  discussed.

  adopted a new international natural rubber agreement in geneva.
the new pact is more responsive to market trends than its
  predecessor, the sources said, and earlier provisions allowing
  the buffer stock to borrow from banks have been eliminated.

bank of japan buys dollars in tokyo, dealers say
  the bank of japan bought a modest amount
  of dollars at around 145.10 yen just after the market here
  opened, dealers said.
just before the opening, the dollar dropped swiftly as
  speculators concluded the group of seven (g-7) comminuique
  issued in washington contained nothing basically new, they
  said.
it fell about a half yen, to around 145.
the g-7 reaffirmed that their currencies around current
  levels reflect economic fundamentals.
one dealer said the bank of japan probably intervened in
  australia before the opening here, but could not confirm this.
miyazawa says yen still inside paris range
  japanese finance minister kiichi
  miyazawa said the strengthening of the yen against the dollar
  that has occurred since the paris agreement was within the
  range agreed on in the louvre discussions.
"i would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past
  several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the
  discussions in paris," miyazawa told a press conference
  following the group of seven meeting here.
he added that the current discussions were a "reaffirmation"

european markets react quietly to g-7 communique
  european currency markets reacted quietly
  to the g-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers
  ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to
  surprise that the markets should have expected so much.
the dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies
  and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which
  reaffirmed support for the paris accord on currency
  stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.
dealers in frankfurt and zurich saw the dollar remaining
  broadly entrenched in its current trading range.
"the dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84
  marks," said gisela steinhaeuser, senior dealer at chase bank
  ag.
she said there was some resistance to further climbs.
however, she said the dollar could break out of the range
  with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected u.s.
merchandise trade deficit, due next tuesday.
theodor stadelmann, dealer with bank julius baer and co ltd
  in zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against
  the mark and swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,
  possibly to 140 yen.
a milan banker shared stadelmann's view, saying he expects
  a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.
london traders said the g-7 communique failed to curb
  underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative
  sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank
  operators to test the downside.
concern that finance ministers and officials still in
  washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of
  currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with
  worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the
  near term, the traders said.
most paris dealers expressed disappointment at the
  communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's
  downward trend.
traders in several centres said the market would look for
  fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to
  defend current ranges, which the communique said were "broadly
  consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
  intentions outlined at the louvre meeting."
dave jouhin, senior dealer at midland bank in london, said
  "they're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon."
the
  u.s. february trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.
however, some dealers said london-based operators would be
  unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long
  easter weekend.
they saw near-term technical support at 1.825
  marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.
chase bank's steinhaeuser and other frankfurt dealers said
  the g-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable
  market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme
  volatility seen in the first few months of this year.
one dealer at a german bank said the wording of the
  communique made clear the leading nations did not want a
  further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.
the german dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to
  1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the louvre
  accord's supposed currency target range.
a swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were
  ready for a period of "mainly sideways movement."
but milan dealers were sceptical about the communique
  contributing to greater stability.
"nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big
  boost," said one dealer, while another italian banker said he
  expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 german marks
  in the next three months.
a swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, said
  the communique had been in line with realistic expectations and
  should not have produced disappointment.
"the problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and trade
  policies to redress current imbalances are of a different
  timescale than currency markets operate on," the source told
  reuters, "this is a political process which takes time."
alois schwietert, chief economist at swiss bank corp in
  basle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident on
  currency markets today.
"did people really expect a patent
  remedy?"
he asked.
bank economists in paris noted yesterday's meeting was only
  the first in a series and said the market would watch carefully
  in the next few weeks for any changes in positions.
a senior economist with banque indosuez said the focus was
  now on trade and growth rather than interest rates.
any move by
  japan and west germany to boost their economic growth could
  lead to a quick change in the u.s.
position.
dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary in
  pushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming months
  while central banks appear resolved to use their muscle to
  support the paris accord.
german money market split on lower rate prospects
  remarks by central bankers raised some
  hopes the bundesbank will cut rates on securities repurchase
  pacts, but operators remained divided on the likelihood of a
  move in the near term, money market dealers said.
comments by bundesbank board member claus koehler yesterday
  that rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth from
  speculative capital inflows, and by west berlin state central
  bank president dieter hiss that there was no natural lower
  limit to the discount rate had, however, no immediate impact.
call money declined to 3.65/75 pct from 3.75/85 pct but the
  drop was tied to extra liquidity in the market, dealers said.
dealers said the bundesbank's latest liquidity allotment
  this week dashed some hopes of lower rates.
the bundesbank allotted only 6.1 billion marks yesterday in
  new liquidity in a repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of 3.80
  pct, thus subtracting some 8.8 billion marks from the market,
  as an outgoing 14.9 billion pact expired.
but some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by the
  pact was in line with present liquid money market conditions,
  and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to
  3.70 pct if money market rates continue at present levels.
the next opportunity for the bundesbank to lower rates on
  repurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next tuesday.
bundesbank officials have already said they favour more
  discreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather than
  the more public adjustment of leading rates.
the bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate and
  allow banks to tender for the volume, as has been the case
  since it lowered its discount rate january 22, or else it may
  allow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself.
dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the
  15.2 billion marks flowing out, to offset other incoming funds.
some seven billion marks is expected to flow in next week.
this should then flow back into the market as it is deposited
  with banks.
banks were well supplied with liquidity, holding 61.5
  billion marks in reserves at the bundesbank on tuesday.
holdings of average daily reserves over the first seven
  days of april stood at 59.6 billion marks, still above the
  estimated 51 billion required for all of april.
thailand to renew long term sugar contracts -trade
  thailand is to negotiate tomorrow with
  selected trade houses for renewal of long term raw sugar sales
  contracts, to cover the next five years at a rate of 60,000
  tonnes annually, traders said.
they also reported vague talk algeria may be seeking 50,000
  tonnes of raws tomorrow but details are unclear.
ec launches anti-dumping probe on japanese chips
  the european community launched an
  investigation into allegations of dumping by japanese
  semiconductor makers in a move which diplomats said could mark
  an intensification of world trade strains.
tokyo already faces a deadline of april 17 from washington
  for the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips it
  imports into the u.s.
the ec executive commission said today the european
  electrical component manufacturers association complained that
  japanese firms were selling high capacity eprom type (erasable
  programmable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices.
japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr ec eprom
  market, up from 60 pct in 1984.
the ec firms said they had been
  forced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct in
  order to compete with the japanese.
the commission said it believed the association had given
  sufficient elements of proof for dumping to warrant an
  investigation, which could lead it to impose duties if it found
  the complaints were justified.
the commission claims last year's accord between the u.s.
  and japan on microchip pricing gives u.s. firms privileged
  access to the japanese market.
swiss to launch new series of money market paper
  the swiss federal government will launch
  a new series of three month money market certificates totalling
  around 150 mln swiss francs, the national bank said.
subscriptions close april 14 and payment date is april 16.
the last series of three month paper issued in march raised
  147.3 mln francs at an issue price of 99.142 pct, giving an
  average annual yield of 3.501 pct.
european markets react quietly to g-7 communique
  european currency markets reacted quietly
  to the g-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers
  ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to
  surprise that the markets should have expected so much.
the dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies
  and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which
  reaffirmed support for the paris accord on currency
  stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.
frankfurt and zurich dealers saw the dollar staying broadly
  entrenched in its current trading range.
finance ministers agree on need for stability
  finance ministers from seven major
  industrialized nations agreed on the need to stabilize
  currencies at current levels but said more action was needed to
  reduce trade imbalances and sustain economic growth.
in a communique issued after a four-hour meeting at the
  u.s. treasury that ended last night, the ministers said the
  value of the dollar and other currencies was basically correct
  now, and they welcomed new measures planned by the japanese to
  boost their economy.
west german finance minister gerhard stoltenberg called it
  a "good meeting" and in brief remarks exchanged with reporters
  other ministers seemed pleased with its outcome.
shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreign
  exchange trading opened in tokyo, the bank of japan intervened
  again to prevent the yen rising too quickly.
the communique said, "the ministers and governors reaffirmed
  the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent
  paris meeting.
they agreed, however, that further actions will
  be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain
  global economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances."
it welcomed the plans set this week by the japan's ruling
  liberal democratic party to stimulate its economy with what the
  communique termed "extraordinary and urgent measures" including
  an "unprecedented front-end loading of public works
  expenditures."
the meeting of the so-called group of seven brought
  together ministers and central bank governors of the seven
  major industrial democracies, the united states, japan, west
  germany, france, britain, italy and canada.
the communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitment
  on cooperation reached in a meeting on february 22 in paris
  when they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the
  then-current levels.
in the weeks that followed, the dollar continued to fall
  against the japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases by
  the bank of japan and other central banks and is now trading at
  around postwar lows.
japan has come under growing criticism from both the united
  states and european countries for its only modest efforts to
  open its markets to outside competition and to reduce its
  exports.
the communique said japan affirmed its intention to open
  domestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not
  elaborate.
it said the officials "reaffirmed the view that around
  current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly
  consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
  intentions outlined at the louvre meeting."
aegon expects moderate rise in 1987 profits
  dutch insurer aegon nv &lt;aegn.as>
  reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mln
  guilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profits
  for 1987.
total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion
  guilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985.
the company said its
  revenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a
  change in accounting practice.
it added that revenues would
  have risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.
revenue from dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly
  due to its life insurance business.
health insurance revenues in the netherlands also rose
  despite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and
  higher personal risks.
damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage
  insurances.
aegon did not specify the loss.
in the united states, revenue in guilders from health and
  life insurance was lower.
aegon said this was due to a change
  in accounting for u.s.
annuities.
aegon said annuities are subject to such strong personal
  investment influences that it should be accounted differently
  from the more traditional insurances.
this change in accounting practice and another change to
  account for profits made on fixed interest investments,
  resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln
  guilders.
aegon said incidental negative influences on net profits
  were slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial
  costs for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in the
  hague.
in 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged
  in the netherlands and the u.s., aegon said.
large initial
  costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.
monumental corp, a u.s. insurer which merged with aegon in
  may 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these
  costs and made only a small contribution to the group's
  profits.
aegon said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill
  for monumental corp.
      aegon's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in december
  1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.
g-7 issues statement after meeting
  following is the text of a statement
  by the group of seven -- the u.s., japan, west germany, france,
  britain, italy and canada -- issued after a washington meeting
  yesterday.
1.
the finance ministers and central bank governors of
  seven major industrial countries met today.
they continued the process of multilateral surveillance of
  their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened
  economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 tokyo summit of
  their heads of state or government.
the managing director of the international monetary fund
  also participated in the meeting.
2.
the ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to
  the cooperative approach agreed at the recent paris meeting,
  and noted the progress achieved in implementing the
  undertakings embodied in the louvre agreement.
they agreed, however, that further actions will be
  essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain
  global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.
in this connection they welcomed the proposals just
  announced by the governing liberal democratic party in japan
  for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate japan's
  economy through early implementation of a large supplementary
  budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as
  unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.
the government of japan reaffirmed its intention to further
  open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.
3.
the ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that
  around current levels their currencies are within ranges
  broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic
  policy intentions outlined at the louvre meeting.
in that connection they welcomed the strong implementation
  of the louvre agreement.
they concluded that present and prospective progress in
  implementing the policy undertakings at the louvre and in this
  statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to
  foster the stability of exchange rates.
g-7 wants to show markets its resolve - miyazawa
  japanese finance minister kiichi
  miyazawa said the group of seven (g-7) countries reaffirmed
  their paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince the
  market of their resolve.
at a news conference after today's g-7 meeting, miyazawa
  said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a
  totally new statement was needed.
the speculative selling did not reflect economic
  fundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only a
  reaffirmation of the goals of the paris accord was needed, he
  said.
he also noted that this test of the g-7 nations resolve had
  concentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially the
  mark, had remained stable.
miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the
  paris accord was not worth being called fundamental.
"as i said at a time of louvre (agreement), the expression
  of 'current level' is rather vague idea," he said.
the yen's movement in the past several weeks is within the
  range agreed in paris in febraury, he said.
it was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointing
  a level, which could have an adverse impact on the market,
  miyazawa said.
asked why only japan was committed to fresh measures in the
  statement, he said japan was exceptional among the seven
  because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other
  major currencies largely have been stable.
he also said japan's ruling liberal democratic party has
  justed adoped a package to reflate the economy while other
  nations are not supposed to produce new measures in a short
  period since the paris agreement.
miyazawa also said the u.s. sanctions against japanese
  semiconductor products was not discussed through the g-7
  meeting and did not affect the currency talks.
the seven nations discussed the debt problems of developing
  countries and ways to proceed in line with the debt initiative
  outlined by u.s. treasury secretary james baker 18 months ago.
yen seen rising after g-7 communique
  the yen is likely to start another
  uneven rise against the dollar and other major currencies
  because the group of seven communique contained nothing new,
  currency and bond analysts here said.
"is that it?
i was expecting something more than that," said
  one trader at a major wall street securities company.
marc cohen of republic national bank of new york said: "the
  market now has the impetus to drive the dollar lower again."
the dollar hovered between 145.50 and 147 yen in the days
  just before the talks.
dealers restrained their underlying
  bearishness and squared positions ahead of wednesday's meeting
  of the finance ministers and central bankers of the top seven
  industrialized nations in washington.
after more than four hours of talks, the g-7 issued a
  communique which merely reaffirmed the recent paris agreement's
  view that prevailing currency levels were broadly consistent
  with economic fundamentals and that exchange rate stability
  should be fostered around these levels.
the dollar sank to 144.75 yen in early tokyo trading.
"they said that the dollar/yen rate was broadly in line with
  fundamentals when it was 154.
now they are saying it's in line
  when it's at 146.
will this still be so at 138 or 130?," asked
  republic's cohen.
japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa fuelled
  speculation about the amount of fluctuation the authorities are
  prepared to tolerate by saying that the current yen level is
  still inside the range agreed on in paris in late february.
official statements in recent weeks had indicated that the
  key psychological level of 150 yen was at the lower end of the
  authorities' permissible range.
dealers and analysts warned that the dollar's decline would
  probably be uneven.
they anticipated a concerted effort to prop
  up the dollar and restrain the yen via a mixture of open market
  intervention and public comments.
shortly after the tokyo market opened today the bank of
  japan was detected by local dealers buying moderate amounts of
  dollars.
the dollar rebounded to about 145.20 yen.
the sources said the market may also be wary of agressively
  selling dollars for yen before tuesday's february u.s. trade
  data.
the figures are expected to show a deficit of 13 billion
  dlrs, from a provisional 14.8 billion in january.
japan business leaders say g-7 accord is worrying
  the leaders of two of japan's top business
  groups said in separate statements the group of seven (g-7)
  accord reached in washington yesterday is of deep concern to
  japan because it shows the major industrial nations regard the
  yen's current level as appropriate.
eishiro saito, chairman of the federation of economic
  organizations (keidanren), said the yen's present rate is well
  above adequate levels.
he did not elaborate.
takashi ishihara, chairman of the japan committee for
  economic development, said the accord will not prevent the yen
  from rising further.
"we do not understand why the g-7 approved present rates as
  the yen has risen excessively since the paris accord," ishihara
  said.
g-7 members britain, canada, france, italy, japan, the u.s.
  and west germany said in a statement they consider their
  currencies are now within ranges broadly consistent with
  economic fundamentals.
saito called on each g-7 member nation to prepare to
  intervene in the market strongly enough to ensure exchange
  rates are stabilised at appropriate levels.

west german beet plantings delayed three weeks
  unseasonal cold weather has delayed
  sugar beet plantings in west germany by up to three weeks, the
  agriculture ministry said.

  weather and started plantings in the past two days.
west german planting intentions this year are put at
  381,000 hectares, down from 390,500 ha last year, he said,
  adding that the 1980/1985 average was 405,000 ha.

  the u.n. food and agriculture organisation
  (fao) said global wheat and coarse grain output was likely to
  fall in 1987 but supplies would remain adequate to meet demand.
fao said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total world
  grain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in
  1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the soviet
  union, drought in china and reduced plantings in north america.
world cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast to
  rise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening the
  impact of reduced production.
but stocks are unevenly
  distributed, with about 50 pct held by the u.s.
      "thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for many
  developing countries, particularly in africa, depend crucially
  on the outcome of this year's harvests," fao said.
fao said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated at
  a record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than last
  season and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986
  harvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes.
fao's forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revised
  upwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood of
  substantial buying by china and the soviet union.

physio technology &lt;phyt> sees loss, in default
  physio technology inc said it
  expects to have a third quarter, ended march 31, loss of about
  200,000 dlrs and is in default on its bank loan because of the
  resignation of chairman and chief executive officer.
the company said the loss followed four quarters of modest
  profits.
in the year ago quarter it earned 11,000 dlrs, or one
  cent a share.
for the first half of fiscal 1987, it reported a
  profit of 42,000 dlrs, or two cts a share, compared to a year
  earlier loss of 294,000 dlrs, or 17 cts a share.
it said president michael r. hall will assume the duties of
  chief executive officer.
physio technology said the resignation of chairman james c.
  lane can constitute non-compliance with its series a
  convertible subordinated debentures due 1996 and a default
  under its agreement with the merchants bank of kansas city.
it explained a declaration of non-compliance under the
  debentures would create a a default under the loan agreements
  requiring immediate payment of 1.8 mln dlrs of debentures and
  about 450,000 dlrs outstanding under the bank credit line.
the company said the debenture holders intend to waive the
  non-compliance, but reserve the right to withdraw the waiver at
  the end of any 30 day period.
physio technology said it is changing its field sales force
  to independent representatives and dealers from employees to
  "significantly reduce its fixed overhead."
its statement did not indicate how many employees would be
  affected by the move.
the company said lane will become an independent dealter
  for the company in certain midwestern states.
he will continue
  to serve as a director, it added.

london freight market features grain out of u.s.
moderately active grain fixing was

a steady 13.50 dlrs was paid from the u.s. gulf to morocco
  and 23.25 dlrs was paid for 27,000 long tons from the gulf to
  taiwan.
a vessel carrying 13,500 long tons of bagged wheat
  flour from the gulf to aqaba received a lump sum of 472,500
  dlrs.
grain from the great lakes to algeria made 28 dlrs against
  27.75 paid for similar fixing towards the end of march.
market talk suggested a federal commerce vessel had been
  booked to move grain from the great lakes to morocco on comanav
  account at about 22 dlrs and 15.50 had been paid for a cargo of
  oilseeds from british columbia to japan, but no confirmation
  was obtainable.

bundesbank sees no change in monetary course
  the bundesbank sees no current reason
  to change monetary course, vice-president helmut schlesinger
  told reuters in a telephone interview.
schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks
  yesterday by bundesbank board member claus koehler and west
  berlin state central bank president dieter hiss, which, dealers
  said, revived some speculation that german interest rate cuts
  may once again be under discussion.
schlesinger said he had no comment on the remarks of his
  two central bank council colleagues.
but he added that the last central bank council meeting on
  april 2 had discussed the economic situation with a mood of
  "subdued optimism," particularly influenced by the news brought
  by several state central bank presidents.
"much is going better than the impression gained by the
  public from the january figures, which have been in the
  meantime superseded," he said.
german january industrial output fell 3.0 pct after a
  decline of 0.9 pct in december.
new industry orders fell 1.9
  pct after they had been unchanged in december.
bank economists said that the two together showed the
  economy would either stagnate or contract in the first quarter
  of 1987.
aside from the economic developments, schlesinger added, a
  steady monetary course was important to hold the dollar/mark
  rate around current levels as bundesbank president karl otto
  poehl had said while attending the washington world bank/imf
  meeting.
asked, however, if the bundesbank could move to cut rates
  on repurchase agreements at the setting of the next repurchase
  tender, due next tuesday, schlesinger said, "since the central
  bank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14
  days, this is hardly probable."
responding to the question whether the bundesbank had moved
  away from a policy of targetting monetary growth toward one of
  targetting currency rates, schlesinger said he could have no
  comment on the subject while negotiations were still in
  progress in washington.

u.s. said to view g-7 meeting as major success
  the united states, which has long
  sought japanese action to stimulate its economy, appears to be
  satisfied tokyo's latest package is a major development and
  allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement
  to stabilize currencies.
monetary sources said they believed that u.s. treasury
  secretary james baker considered tokyo's package, announced
  yesterday, to be a major stimulation of the japanese economy.
but yesterday's statement by seven leading industrial
  powers endorses the yen's rise from around 153 to the dollar,
  the level at the february 22 paris accord, to about 145 today.
and the initial reaction of currency markets in the far
  east demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that
  currencies yet reflect economic fundamentals, even though the
  countries appear to do so.
the yen sank below 145 at one point
  despite intervention by the bank of japan.
kiichi miyazawa, japan's finance minister, said the
  movement since paris was consistent with currency trading
  ranges the nations agreed to defend in the february talks.
"i would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past
  several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the
  discussions in paris," miyazawa said yesterday.
the supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was
  announced by the ruling liberal democratic party on the eve of
  miyazawa's departure for washington, to attend yesterday's
  meetings of leading industrial nations.
in a strongly worded statement terming the japanese action
  "extraordinary and urgent", the meeting reaffirmed the paris
  accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges
  broadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.
the group of seven -- the united states, japan, west
  germany, france, britain, italy and canada -- therefore
  repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to
  foster exchange rate stability.
the cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central
  bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the
  dollar's fall.
while relatively unsuccessful, the scale of
  intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent
  years.
monetary sources also said they understood that
  secretary baker considered the meeting to be extremely
  successful in the light of the japanese announcement.
they also said there was a growing feeling among the
  finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over
  medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term
  differences in past meetings.
west germany, whose currency has not risen anything like
  the yen since the paris agreement, appears from the face of
  yesterday's statement to have won acceptance from other
  countries that its exchange rate is acceptable.
bonn's finance minister gerhard stoltenberg argues that
  major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance
  between west germany and japan's trade surpluses and america's
  trade deficit have already taken place.
no mention was made, however, of the u.s. commitment to cut
  the budget deficit even though it is implied in the
  reafffirmation of paris.
european nations and japan believe deficit cuts are
  essential to curbing the record u.s. trade shortfall that
  reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.
a similar argument was made on capitol hill earlier this
  week by federal reserve board chairman paul volcker.
a further
  sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would "clearly pose
  substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could
  undermine confidence in future financial stability," he said.
volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the
  politically independent fed to drive up interest rates.
monetary sources said that, privately, west germany
  welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own
  currency remained relatively stable against the u.s. unit.
bonn and other european nations worry that once the weak
  dollar blunts tokyo's export drive to the united states, the
  japanese monolith will concentrate on european markets.
the ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making
  their policy coordination more binding and one, canadian
  finance minister michael wilson, said good progress was made.
wilson said they will meet before the june economic summit
  to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.
the united states and france, backed by the international
  monetary fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or "norms" for a
  limited number of economic objectives such as growth,
  inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current
  account balances.
sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in
  consultations between the countries on whether corrective
  action should be required.
but the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives
  has bonn and london worried, monetary sources say, because it
  implies washington is moving in the direction of target zones.
the sources said the reagan administration unsuccessfully
  sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit
  currency fluctuations just before the february meeting.
the concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges
  of the paris accord and would mark a sharp departure from the
  relatively free currency markets of recent years.
bank of france leaves intervention rate unchanged
  the bank of france said it left its
  intervention rate unchanged at 7-3/4 pct when it injected funds
  in the market against first category paper in today's money
  market intervention tender.
money market dealers had earlier expressed mixed views on
  the possibility of quarter point cut.
the rate was last adjusted on march 9, when it was cut to
  7-3/4 pct from the eight pct rate set in january.
global economic slowdown raises new debt fears
  the global economy is expected to
  weaken this year, adding new worries to an already serious
  poverty outlook, economic analysts said.
for finance ministers and central bankers attending this
  week's semi-annual meetings of the international monetary fund
  and world bank, the new figures released by the imf add an
  additional concern.
the fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct
  this year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.
in the industrial countries, gross national product, a
  measure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to
  2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the imf said.
for the developing countries, the gross domestic product,
  another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0
  pct from 3.5 pct last year.
the new figures are considered a major disappointment to
  the poorest countries.
they had hoped that new vitality in the
  industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil
  prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope
  with growing mounds of debt.
imf officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed
  the industrial country economies would move up to an annual
  growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.
economic analysts and the imf have been saying for some
  time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into
  an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.
since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier
  states for markets for their products as well as financial
  assistance, economic weakness in the developed nations' 
  economies poses fundamental worries.
debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have
  only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange,
  including the key one of exports.
the u.s. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion,
  has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it
  too is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only
  2.3 pct, according to the imf.
for this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the
  united states has been pressuring japan and west germany to
  ignite their economies but with little apparent success.
the imf study also examines the course of the dollar and
  the curious lack of impact it has had on the u.s. trade
  deficit.
reagan administration officials have been saying that the
  impact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much
  slower than expected.
the imf observed in its world economic outlook that "it has
  to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to
  work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years
  to get a resonably complete effect."
the report added, however, "the adjustments may take even
  more time on this occasion."

spanish employers worried by high interest rates
  the head of spain's employers'
  federation, jose maria cuevas, said employers were worried
  about the government's monetary policies because high real
  interest rates were hampering investment.
he told a news conference wage pacts signed so far this
  year were not endangering the government's five pct inflation
  target.
the government's perceived need to control inflation by
  keeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.
high real interest rates were attracting an influx of
  speculative foreign capital which was undercutting the
  government's target for monetary growth, cuevas said.
spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply,
  liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17
  pct in march, against 11.4 pct in december last year and a
  target range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.
to combat this, the bank of spain has raised its call money
  rate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from
  11.8 at end-1986.
cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call to
  hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,
  with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new
  wage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.
these agreements covered less than 40 pct of spanish
  workers, cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.
he said spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected the
  state sector, where the government is trying to impose its five
  pct wage ceiling.
cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in
  spain's foreign trade balance.
the trade deficit in the first
  two months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct
  increase over the corresponding period last year.
however, employers did not favour a devaluation of the
  peseta to correct the imbalance.
showboat &lt;sbo> declares stock split
  showboat inc said its board declared a
  two-for-one stock split, payable to shareholders of record on
  may 15.
lead prices rise on finely balanced physicals
  lead prices have risen this week against
  a background of a finely balanced physical sector, traders
  said.
further gains are possible if the ussr steps up its buying
  or if labour problems develop in north america, they added.
london metal exchange (lme) prices are unusually buoyant at
  a time of year when seasonal demand is normally slackening and
  prices tending to drift lower.
this buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the low
  level of lme stocks and steady, if unspectacular, physical
  demand in the northern hemisphere finding supplies curtailed.
the supply problems are not new but are beginning to be
  felt by a market in which, as peak winter demand tails off,
  stocks usually build fast and availability increases, traders
  said.
the lower supply levels result from a number of different
  factors around the globe.
delayed shipments from peru to mediterranean countries
  because of production and transport problems, lack of spanish
  exports since the closure last year of cia la cruz's smelter at
  linares and lower output in morocco and greece have all meant
  additional demand being directed to merchants who in turn have
  been drawing on lme stocks.
in addition broken hill associated smelters' port pirie,
  south australia, smelter is halting production for five weeks
  for maintenance.
although the company said it would meet
  commitments, this will put further pressure on stocks.
and the u.s. company doe run has kept its 140,000 tonnes
  per year boss, montana smelter closed.
this cut producer stocks
  and contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within the
  u.s. market, for many years depressed by surplus production and
  a regular supplier to the world market.
mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled lme stocks,
  have been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said.
on the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held up
  quite well and some u.s. buying of lead sheet has been reported
  in the u.k. soviet lead buying, notably absent in europe in the
  first two months of the year, was resumed when a large buying
  order was filled by merchants in march.
merchant demand has fuelled the rise in lme lead prices
  this week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg and
  establish a premium of around 10 stg over three months
  delivery.
specific demand has been directed towards metal in
  gothenburg and trieste warehouses.
gothenburg material is often
  a target for merchants shipping to the ussr, traders said.
on stocks, the popular lme continental warehouses, antwerp
  and rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each,
  and this is believed to be in strong hands.
out of a total 22,125 tonnes in lme stocks, the lowest
  level since june 1980, just over half is in u.k.
warehouses
  which are not popular with merchants putting together
  shipments.
but even u.k. stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes since
  the start of the year.
traders said this is partly due to
  secondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed supplies
  affected by environmental controls, which put restrictions on
  the transport of used batteries.
labour negotiations in north america will play an important
  part in determining the direction of prices, with contracts
  expiring end-april at cominco's trail and kimberley, b.c.,
  mine/smelter and at doe run's herculaneum, mo, smelter.
noranda's new brunswick mine/smelter also has a contract
  expiry in july which may cause some nervousness in view of
  strikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months.
traders said lme three months delivery, already attracting
  speculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on current
  firmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium
  to 20 from four.
three months was quoted at 313 stg at
  midsession.

  without the purchase of any purolator common stock.
hutton added that pc acquisition also terminated its merger
  agreement with purolator.
hutton said the offer, which had been conditioned upon the

  two-thirds of the outstanding shares, was terminated because
  the minimum number of shares was not tendered.
purolator had entered into a definitive agreement with pc

  hutton, and some officers of purolator's u.s. courier division,
  in which pc offered to purchase 6,332,471 purolator common

following that move, pc acquisition planned to merge a
  subsidiary into purolator, converting all outstanding purolator
  common it did not own into an aggregate 46 mln dlrs principal
  amount of 12 pct guaranteed debentures due 2002 and warrants to
  purchase 15 pct of a purolator unit comprised of purolator's
  u.s courier operations.
hutton said as of 2400 edt yesterday about 181,000 shares
  of purolator common stock, or about 2.4 pct of the outstanding
  shares, had been validly tendered and not withdrawn.
pc acquisition has instructed its depository for the offer
  to return promptly the purolator stock deposited by, or on
  behalf of, tendering shareholders, hutton said.

india foodgrain target 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88
  india's national foodgrain target has
  been fixed at 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88 (apr-mar), unchanged
  from the 1986/87 target, the agriculture ministry said in its
  annual report for 1986/87.
actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87
  due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterological
  sub-divisions of the country.
the report gave the targets for various crops with
  estimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following,
  in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grains
  including sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13).
despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it was
  possible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifying
  growing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said.
the strategy for increasing irrigation potential along with
  greater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement in
  fertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, adding
  total foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84
  respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4
  mln.
india has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnes
  of foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-year
  development plan ending march 31, 1990.
taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the
  1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gap
  of 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining three
  years of the plan by increasing grain output annually by more
  than nine mln tonnes.
but the target can be achieved only with
  good weather, the report said.
"the major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water
  (irrigation) management.
simultaneously, efforts for spread of
  improved technology including timely use of inputs (farm
  materials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to be
  vigrously pursued," it said.

reichhold chemical &lt;rci> sets anti-takeover plan
  reichhold chemical inc said its
  board adopted a warrant dividend plan in which one preferred
  stock purchase right will be distributed as a dividend on each
  common share outstanding.
the company said its warrant dividend plan is designed to
  protect its shareholders against unsolicted, coercive attempts
  to aquire control without making an adequate offer for all
  shares.
reichhold said the adoption is not a response to any
  specific takeover attempt.
reichhold said each right will entitle shareholders to buy
  one one-hundreth of a share of a newly created series of
  preferred stock at an initial exercise price of 120 dlrs, with
  dividend and voting rights approximately equal to those of one
  share of the company's common stock.
the rights will be exercisable only if, without reichhold's
  prior consent, a person or group a acquires 20 pct or more of
  the voting power or announces a tender offer which would result
  in 20 pct ownership, the company said.
reichhold said it is entitled to redeem the rights at five
  cts apiece before a 20 pct position has been acquired, or
  before an existing 20 pct shareholder buys an additional two
  pct or more of the voting power of the company, or in
  connection with certain transactions afterward.
the tax-free distribution will become effective may 1,
  1987, and will expire 10 years later, the company said.
details of the plan are outlined in a letter to be mailed
  to stockholders.

spain has 35 mln dlr current surplus february
  spain had a 35 mln dlr current account
  surplus in february compared with a 68 mln dlr surplus in
  january and a 355 mln dlr surplus in february last year, bank
  of spain figures show.
spain's trade deficit narrowed to 581 mln dlrs compared
  with 664 mln dlrs in january but the large increase in non-oil
  imports contributed to the substantial increase over the 159
  mln dlr deficit registered in february 1986.
exports at 2.58 billion dlrs were up 19 pct compared with
  february last year, but imports were 46 pct higher than last
  february, totalling 3.16 billion dlrs.
non-oil imports totalled 2.79 billion dlrs compared with
  1.91 billion in february last year, reflecting the large
  ammount of investment goods entering the country with the
  recovery of the spanish economy, the bank of spain said.
spain's tourism earnings continued to grow and totalled 655
  mln dlrs in february, compared with 103 mln dlrs in january and
  502 mln dlrs in february last year.
india oilseed output forecast to rise
  india's oilseed output is expected to

  the agriculture ministry's 1986/87 report said.
but the forecast for 1986/87 is well below a target of 14.8
  mln tonnes fixed for the year, it said, adding bad weather hit
  groundnut and other oilseed crops.
the national oilseeds development program will invest 300
  mln rupees in 1986/87 on supplying improved high-yielding seeds

vw says 480 mln marks maximum for currency losses
  losses for volkswagen ag
  &lt;vowg.f>, vw, linked to an alleged foreign currency fraud will
  not exceed the 480 mln marks provision already made, a vw
  spokesman said.
the spokesman was commenting after vw had confirmed it
  would pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on
  1986 business, despite the provision.
one west german newspaper today quoted foreign currency
  dealers in frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from
  the currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, but
  the vw spokesman described 480 mln marks as an "upper limit."
vw said in a statement following today's supervisory board
  meeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal in
  detail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreign
  currency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditing
  company.
vw has said computer programs were erased and documents
  were faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes
  transactions intended to protect it against possible foreign
  currency losses were not completed.
vw's former foreign currency chief burkhard junger was
  arrested on monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having
  evaded justice.
earlier vw had said that its 1986 results would match 1985
  profits.
vw's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and
  parent company net was 477 mln marks.
it also said it recommend
  an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board.
the company has
  also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares,
  which were issued last year.
analysts have described the held
  dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders.
vw increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5
  billion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment
  on 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985,
  since the new capital was in preference shares.
the share analysts say vw will have to dig into reserves in
  order to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels.
at
  the end of 1985, vw had parent company reserves of slightly
  less than three billion marks.
yugoslavia to tender for 100,000 tonnes wheat

  from other suppliers will not be considered.
it said the imports will be used to rebuild the federal
  reserves and as a result will not be subject to import
  surcharges.

  national computer systems inc
  expects fiscal year earnings to improve by about 20 pct, the

  quarter should show "down earnings and virtually flat
  revenues."
chairman charles oswald said national computer has taken
  steps to improve margins.
he said revenues are expected to
  increase modestly because of the company's decision to downsize
  its leasing business, nonrecurring revenueslast year from a
  one-time texas teacher assessment project and the impact of the
  discontinuance of products last year.
oswald said national computer's first quarter results will
  be down as a result of a major financial systems sales last
  year, a higher effective tax rate and the increased number of
  shares outstanding.
the company said the next three consecutive quarters should
  demonstrate "excellent earnings growth."

lawson says some countries could cut rates
  nigel lawson, britain's chancellor of
  the exchequer, said some countries may need to cut interest
  rates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability.
speaking to journalists one day after the group of seven
  countries reaffirmed goals set in paris six weeks ago, he said
  central banks would continue to intervene "as and when
  necessary."
he said the g-7 countries were concerned that japan do more
  to stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by
  japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa yesterday.
lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of a
  simultaneous recession in the united states, japan and west
  germany, though less so than when he gave his march 17 budget
  speech to the british parliament.
"if anything i'm a little bit less concerned, but there is
  still a risk," he said.
asked if the united states should consider increasing
  interest rates to support the dollar, he said, "if there is a
  need for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn't need to
  be a rise in interest rates in the united states."
lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday's
  meetings at the slow progress the united states had made in
  reducing its budget deficit.
"we believe there will be some worthwhile progress in
  reducing the deficit this year.
the important thing is that it
  continue year after year," lawson said.
the february 22 louvre accord called for efforts to
  stabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates.
in the six
  weeks that followed the japanese yen continued to rise against
  the dollar despite massive central bank intervention.
asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in
  the louvre accord, he said, "i don't think so.
if there had been
  no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness."
although intervention could be a cause of inflation, lawson
  said, "the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode
  ... but one has to be vigilant."
he said yesterday's g-7 statement, which affirmed that
  "current levels" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been
  "carefully worded."
"we know what we mean, and we all mean the
  same thing," he said.
lawson said financial markets seem to believe that japanese
  measures outlined in the louvre accord were the source of
  weakness for that agreement.
therefore, the g-7 countries welcomed miyazawa's
  presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate
  domestic demand.
they particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate
  increase in public works spending, but lawson said the package
  also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during
  the second half of this year.
french free market cereal export bids detailed
  french operators have requested licences
  to export 320,000 tonnes of free market barley, 225,000 tonnes
  of maize, 25,000 tonnes of free market bread-making wheat and
  20,000 tonnes of feed wheat at today's ec tender, trade sources
  said.
for the barley, rebates of between 138 and 141.25 european
  currency units (ecus) per tonne were sought, for maize they
  were between 129.65 and 139 ecus, for bread-making wheat around
  145 ecus and for feed wheat around 142.45 ecus.
barley rebates of up to 138.50 ecus were requested for a
  total of 40,000 tonnes and at 139 ecus for 85,000 tonnes.
rebates of up to 130 ecus per tonne were requested for a
  total of 55,000 tonnes maize and up to 131 ecus for 105,000
  tonnes, the sources said.

potato futures trading not to be suspended
  trading on the london potato futures
  market will not be suspended, richard harris, chairman of the
  london potato futures association (lpfa), said in a statement
  to floor members.
it was in response to strong representations by the potato
  marketing board (pmb) complaining of a gross distortion of
  price which they say will result in large deliveries into the
  physical market when the april futures position expires.
the pmb had sought an immediate suspension in futures
  trading and asked the lpfa to take action to restore the
  relationship between futures and physicals.
farmers and merchants have alleged a squeeze and cornering
  of the market but harris pointed out that recent investigations
  by the association of futures brokers and dealers (afbd), the
  international commodities clearing house (icch) and other
  parties, found no evidence to substantiate this.
the main complaint from some sections of the physical
  market is what they say is an unrealistic futures premium over
  the pmb's average ex-farm price.
april futures traded this
  morning between 168 and 170 stg per tonne compared with pmb's
  average price of 104 stg.
bill englebright, joint secretary of the lpfa said there is
  a two-tier market for physical potatoes.
he said quality
  potatoes are in short supply and prepackers have been paying
  between 145 and 165 stg per tonne for best samples.
but lesser
  quality grades have traded below 100 stg.
some merchants fear that a large tonnage will be delivered
  against the april futures contract between now and the end of
  the month, and possibly disrupt the physical market.
harris said the lpfa rule book allows the management
  committee to take steps as necessary to correct any malpractice
  and he assured the committee is monitoring the situation.
group of 10 welcomes latest g-7 agreement

  stability in the exchange rates of their currencies."
the g-10 includes the group of seven - the united states,
  canada, britain, japan, italy, west germany and france - plus
  belgium, the netherlands, sweden and also switzerland.
sources who attended the g-10 conference this morning said
  the reference to the latest g-7 agreement was especially added
  to the brief communique because currency stability will benefit
  all the g-10 members.
the g-10 met briefly before the international monetary fund
  interim committee meeting scheduled for today.

spot tin easier on european free market
  spot tin on the european free market was
  indicated in the easier range 4,200 to 4,230 stg per tonne, for
  high grade metal in warehouse rotterdam, down 20 stg from
  yesterday's afternoon kerb close.
stability in sterling versus the dollar continued to apply
  pressure to a market which is coming close to testing a
  psychological chart support base at 4,200 stg, traders said.
dealers said major consumers still need to cover their may
  and june requirements but are holding out for even lower
  offers.
reported high grade tin business in london was confined
  to end april metal at 4,225 stg.
small-scale spot business was reported by west german
  operators at 12.60 and 12.63 marks per kilo although the market
  was still being undercut by chinese material, which traded at
  one stage down to 12.54 marks per kilo, traders said.
dollar ends lower in lacklustre frankfurt
  the dollar drifted down to end one
  pfennig lower after a lacklustre session, held in limits by the
  lack of concrete news from the group of seven meeting and
  comments on the edge of the washington imf/world bank meeting.
dealers said the communique early in the european morning
  from the g-7 meeting contained no significant new factors and
  although the dollar dipped it generally resisted further
  attempts to push it lower through the day.
the u.s. currency ended at 1.8270/80 marks, below
  yesterday's last 1.8365/75.
koch said the assessment of the dollar's direction was
  based on a global view, with operators paying most attention to
  comments by finance officials to see how closely they stated
  adherence to international agreements such as those set at the
  plaza hotel in 1985 and in paris on february 22.
koch described the wording of the communique from the g-7
  as "soft as wax."
bundebank vice-president helmut schlesinger told reuters in
  a telephone interview that the german central bank sees no
  current reason to change monetary course at present.
schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks
  yesterday by bundesbank board member claus koehler and west
  berlin state central bank president dieter hiss, which dealers
  said revived some speculation that german interest rate cuts
  may be under consideration.
german call money was slightly softer today, at around 3.70
  pct after 3.80 yesterday.
some dealers said rates on new liquidity injections added
  via bundesbank securities repurchase agreements may be cut next
  week.
hopes of a cut were dashed on tuesday with an allocation
  at an unchanged 3.80 pct.
but speaking of the pact tender rate next week, schlesinger
  said, "since the central bank council gives its opinion on this
  theme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable."
euromark rates scarcely responded to the central bankers
  comments, with six months funds ending unaltered at around
  3-7/8 pct.
eurodollars for the same maturity rose a fractional
  1/16 pct from yesterday to around 6-11/16 pct.
sterling dipped to end at 2.952/956 marks after 2.960/965
  last night.
the swiss franc firmed slightly to 120.30/45 marks
  per 100 from 120.25/40, with the yen soaring however to
  1.2570/90 marks per 100 from 1.2515/35 yesterday.
ems currencies saw the french franc end unchanged from last
  night at 30.03/06 marks per 100, with the belgian franc easing
  however to 4.829/831 marks per 100 from 4.831/833.

talking point/steel companies
  steel stocks, which have had a healthy
  runup recently, still present some short term investment
  opportunities, according to some steel analysts.
but others say the upturn, based on strong orders and firm
  prices this spring, has been strictly seasonal and will end
  soon.
they recommend taking profits.
"it's that time of year.
this is strictly seasonal," said
  charles bradford of merrill lynch and co. "orders will be
  strong for about two months, and there are signs that some
  (order rates) are starting to dive already."
but dean witter reynolds inc analyst clarence morrison sees
  some short-term potential in the group, which includes usx corp
  &lt;x>, bethlehem steel corp &lt;bs>, armco inc &lt;as> and inland steel
  industries inc &lt;iad>.
"there is still some attractiveness to steels over the
  short- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates and
  rising prices," morrison said.
he only recommends one stock,
  however, inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations to
  make them more efficient.
despite his bearishness, merrill's bradford continues to
  recommend armco, which he sees as a major turnaround.
armco's steelmaking operations are profitable, the balance
  sheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment business
  has been slimmed and put in a joint venture with usx, bradford
  noted.
"it's not a high-quality investment situation yet but
  they've come a long way," he said.
"we think the stock will do moderately better than the
  market," he said.
armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today,
  could go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said.
bradford sees armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987,
  before special gains from recouped investment tax credits,
  against losses last year.
armco's 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, he
  said.
bradford is recommending sale of usx shares.
"we had a buy
  on it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else have
  it," he said.
the steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr a
  share in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, and
  from two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, bradford said.
"but a lot
  depends on oil prices," he added.
about 60 pct of usx's sales
  come from oil and natural gas.
other analysts, including michelle galanter applebaum of
  salomon brothers inc, recommend usx.
"the company's done a lot
  (of restructuring), more than the market's given them credit
  for," she said.
she sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher.
usx was
  trading up 1/8 at 28-1/2.
she predicts usx will earn 18 cts a
  share this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in
  1986.
applebaum, who is also positive on armco and inland, has
  been recommending the stocks since last november.
peter marcus of painewebber inc is neutral on the group
  although he said the earnings outlook is improved through the
  third quarter.
but he sees potential trouble beyond then.
"i think (steel)
  prices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer,"
  he said.
applebaum of salomon brothers also sees some seasonal
  dropoff later in the year.
"but there are more positives than
  negatives," she said, citing reduced capacity in the domestic
  industry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which should
  cause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year.

brazil cotton crop lower -- usda report
  brazil's 1986/87 cotton crop estimate
  has been reduced to 710,000 from 735,000 tonnes (lint basis),
  the u.s. agriculture department's officer in sao paulo said in
  a field report.
the report, dated april 7, said the reduction is based on
  an expected smaller harvest in the center-south region.
the center-south crop is now estimated at 550,000 tonnes --
  25,000 tonnes below the previous estimate.
hot, dry weather during part of january and excessive rains
  in some areas in february reduced yield prospects and may have
  affected quality, the report said.
nearly 60 pct of the crop has been harvested in parana and
  slightly less in sao paulo, it said.
cotton entering gins is of
  fairly good quality, according to trade sources, it said.

brazil cocoa exporters unlikely to limit sales
  brazilian cocoa exporters are not
  likely to follow the example of cocoa producers alliance, cpa,
  members, who may limit sales of the product in an effort to
  boost world prices, trade sources said.
they said a similar procedure was taken in the past in
  brazil and that it did not work out according to plans.
"the cocoa market is completely free.
unlike coffee, which
  is controlled through export registrations, cocoa exporters in
  brazil operate at their own free will," a trade source said.
the traders were responding to questions whether they would
  follow the example of cpa members meeting in yaounde.
the sources said the banco do brasil's foreign trade
  department, cacex, never interferes in the cocoa market by
  rejecting sales that do not meet certain price or shipment
  criteria.
"the position of local producers is always to negotiate as
  they please.
if they buy for ten and sell for eleven and think
  it's a good deal, they are free to go ahead," one source added.

u.s. treasury's baker says rate shifts orderly
  treasury secretary james baker said
  that changes in exchange rates have generally been orderly and
  have improved the prospects for a reduction in external
  imbalances to more sustainable levels.
in remarks before the imf's policy-making interim
  committee, baker reiterated a group of seven statement last
  night that the substantial exchange rate changes since the
  plaza agreement 18 months ago have "now brought currencies
  within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals."
baker said, "these exchange rate shifts have generally been
  orderly, and have improved prospects for the reduction of
  external imbalances to more sustainable levels."
as they are today, the trade and current account imbalances
  "simply are not sustainable," baker told the ministers.
he said that the reagan administration was resisting "strong
  domestic pressure" for trade protection and was working closely
  with the u.s. congress in crafting a trade bill.
"while we cannot yet be sure of the outcome, we are doing
  what we can to ensure that the bill is not protectionist," he
  said.
baker also urged the international monetary fund's
  executive board to review possible modifications to the fund's
  compensatory financing facility before the annual meeting this
  fall.
"we should pay particular attention to the lack of
  continuing conditionality associated with the use of the cff
  and to whether shortfalls in export earnings are indeed
  temporary," he said.

sprinkel says tax hike would not reduce deficit
  council of economic advisers chairman
  beryl sprinkel said the reagan administration remains strongly
  opposed to a tax increase, including 18 billion dlrs of new
  revenues in the budget plan by congressional democrats.
"we believe that significant increases in taxes would not
  reduce deficits and could have adverse effects on growth,"
  sprinkel told the house rules committee.
he said the administration wanted to continue its policy of
  gradually reducing deficits through restraining government
  spending and promoting economic growth.
sprinkel said cutting
  the budget deficit was the best way to lower the trade deficit.

national distillers &lt;dr> sees second qtr gain
  national distillers and chemical corp
  expects to realize a second quarter after-tax gain of four dlrs
  per share from the 545 mln dlr sale of its spirits business to
  american brands inc &lt;amb>.
national distillers' stock rose 1-1/8 to 65-1/2, after an
  opening delay on the new york stock exchange for an imbalance
  of orders.
"i think the sales price was higher than most people
  expected," said john henry of e.f. hutton group.
a company spokeswoman said the four dlr per share gain will
  be included in second quarter net, which compares with 31 cts
  per share last year, including the spirits and wine business
      "they netted over 700 mln dlrs for spirits and wine.
that
  will ease their interest cost burden," said henry.
national distillers sold its wine business last month to
  grand metropolitan plc's heublein inc for 128 mln dlrs.
henry said he had anticipated national distillers would net
  only 600 mln dlrs at the most from the sale of the two liquor
  businesses.
henry said the company recovered from the sales the cost of
  buying enron chemicals in the fourth quarter last year.
national distillers paid 570 mln dlrs cash for enron and
  assumed 34 mln dlrs in debt.
national distillers said at the
  time it bought enron it would sell the spirits and wine
  businesses, moving more into the chemical area.
for 1986, two thirds of income were from chemicals and
  propane.
national distillers earned, excluding the liquor
  businesses, 2.21 dlrs per share for 1986.
income from
  discontinued operations, including the liquor businesses, was
  67 cts per share.

brazil soybean yields seen average - usda report
  based on field travel in the
  brazilian state of parana, soybean yields should be about
  average or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the u.s. agriculture
  department's officer in sao paulo said in a field report.
the report, dated march 24, noted parana accounts for about
  20 to 24 pct of brazil's total soybean crop.
it said generally favorable weather from early december
  through february helped compensate for earlier dryness.
however, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days
  followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second
  week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans
  which are still immature, but the impact may be localized, the
  report said.
the corn crop is expected to be a record and will create
  serious storage problems, the report said.
due to favorable support prices, corn area increased by
  more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields are
  expected to be above average, it said.
due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop
  crop has been harvested.
during the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain
  elevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, the
  report said.
new crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- parana
  accounts for about 60 pct of total production.
major reasons
  for the decline are expected reduced government support price
  and good summer crop harvests.

ec commission authorised to buy maize in june
  the european commission was authorised
  to buy up to one mln tonnes of maize into intervention stores
  in the second half of june, although sales into intervention
  normally end on april 30, commission sources said.
they said approval was given by the ec's cereals management
  committee because of the possible disturbance of the market due
  to heavy imports of maize under the agreement between the ec
  and the united states.
the agreement guarantees access to the spanish market for
  two mln tonnes of non-ec maize a year for the next four years.
the sources said the intervention price for the maize would
  be 201.49 ecus a tonne.
they said at this price it seemed unlikely that the full
      they added the decision is also designed to prevent massive
  offers of maize for intervention just ahead of the normal april
  30 deadline, which could be caused by speculation about the
  implementation of the accord with the united states.

southmark &lt;sm> to offer special dividend
  southmark corp said it will issue its
  shareholders a special dividend right to acquire 22 shares of
  american realty trust &lt;arb> for each 100 shares of southmark
  they own.
each right entitles the holder to buy one share of
  beneficial interest of american realty trust at a price of 3.75
  dlrs per share, southmark said.
southmark said the offer's record date is may 1, with an
  ex-dividend date of april 27, adding that the it will issue the
  rights to shareholders on may 6 and the offer will expire on
  may 22.
southmark said it received the rights on april 6 as the
  holder of about 84 pct of american realty trust's outstanding
  shares.
holders of fewer than 455 southmark shares who would
  receive rights to acquire fewer than 100 american realty shares
  will be paid cash in lieu of the rights distribution, the
  company said.
southmark said it will compute the cash price paid based on
  the average closing market price of the rights on the american
  stock exchange for the first ten days the rights are traded,
  beginning april 6.
in order to get the dividend for these rights a southmark
  shareholder must own common stock on the ex-dividend date,
  april 27, the company said.
after that, southmark said its common stock will be traded
  on an ex-rights basis.

u.s. march retail sales cut by late easter
  u.s. retailers' lackluster march sales
  were due to a late easter, according to analysts who expect a
  recovery in april.
"sales look soft because of the easter shift, but
  underlying business is better than the numbers indicate," said
  bear stearns analyst monroe greenstein.
analysts generally average the sales results of march and
  april to account for the variation of easter's occurance.
this
  year, easter is being observed on april 19, which is three
  weeks later than last year.
analyst edward johnson of johnson redbook associates said
  sales for march rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and a
  seasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted
  5.7 pct last year.
"the obvious question is whether these numbers indicate
  that the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appear
  to be because liquidity and employment are rising," said
  analyst jeff edelman, analyst of drexel lambert and burnham.
overall, analysts said first half sales are coming in
  according to expectations.
sales for all of 1987 are expected
  to rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986's rise.
in march, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticket
  items were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to many
  analysts that apparel sales will be strong in april as the
  holiday nears.
"sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect a
  continuing strength in the housing market," said edward
  brennan, chairman of sears roebuck and co &lt;s> which reported an
  overall sales gain of 4.2 pct.
brennan said sales of women's
  sportswear were also excellent.
"sears' total apparel sales was up only modestly, but even
  a modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishment
  due to the fact that most people will buy apparel in april,"
  said c.j.
lawrence analysts harry mortner.
j.c. penney co inc &lt;jcp> and dayton hudson corp &lt;dh> were
  among the weaker performers with comparable stores sales
  declining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively.
penney's store and
  catalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and dayton hudson's
  overall sales rose 4.8 pct.
penney chairman william howell said, "sales continued
  strong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged from
  very active in the east to weak in the economically depressed
  southwest."
"penney's been shifting away from leisure time activity
  wear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins,
  but are currently hurting sales," said greenstein of bear
  stearns.
hudson chairman kenneth mackes cited the late easter for
  the decline.
edelman of drexel said that "hudson had a tougher
  comparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986."
most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lower
  than last year.
"retailers are not planning for much - inventories are
  being kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but sales
  are coming through anyway," said cj analyst harry mortner.
mortner said he expects profits in the first quarter to  
  be better than he had originally expected in the beginning of
  the year.
most retailers report their first quarter in the middle of
  may.

disease puts zimbabwe beef exports in jeopardy
  zimbabwe's beef exports to the european
  community (ec), potentially worth 70 mln zimbabwean dlrs this
  year, may be jeopardised by an outbreak of foot and mouth
  disease in southwestern matabeleland, industry sources said.
the country has temporarily suspended beef exports to the
  ec because of the outbreak and awaits a decision from the ec
  veterinary committee, which is considering a formal ban.
the outbreak in the country's main ranching province has
  already led neighbouring beef-producing botswana and zambia to
  bar beef and dairy imports from zimbabwe, threatening the dairy
  industry with a loss of at least one mln dlrs in export
  revenue.
"the situation is still uncertain at the moment.
normally
  when an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension of
  beef exports," one industry source said yesterday.
commenting on ec policy, he explained, "depending on the
  seriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee then
  decides on three options, allowing us to continue exporting
  beef from disease-free areas, clamping a three-month suspension
  on exports or banning us from exporting for a year.
we are
  still awaiting their decision," he added, asking not to be
  identified.
zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes of
  high-grade beef to ec markets in 1985 after the country had
  spent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences and
  upgrading abattoirs to meet stringent ec rules.
should the ec ban zimbabwean exports, the country will be
  forced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at low
  prices, the source said.
projected earnings from beef sales
  could fall about 23 mln dlrs as a result, he said.

u.s.
congressman introduces reagan sugar bill
  rep. john porter, r-ill., introduced
  in the house of representatives legislation proposed by the
  reagan administration to slash the u.s. sugar price support, a
  spokesman for porter said.
the spokesman said the bill was introduced without any
  changes from the administration's proposal sent to congress
  last month.
that plan calls for a cut in the sugar loan rate to 12
  cents per pound from 18 cents now.
sugar growers would be
  compensated for the price cut with targeted direct payments,
  to be gradually phased-out through 1990.
the payments to
  growers would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs.
representatives of sugar growers have rejected the
  proposal, saying it would ruin the domestic sugar industry.

consensus seen on tin pact extension
  the quarterly session of the
  international tin council (itc) continued without formal
  agreement on an extension of the sixth international tin
  agreement (ita), but delegates said it was apparent there was a
  general consensus the agreement should be prolonged.
some delegations are still awaiting formal instructions
  from capitals, but informally most have indicated they favour
  an extension, delegates said.
this afternoon's session was used by delegates to seek
  further clarification on some of the issues involved, and to
  discuss internal matters.
some sources were optimistic a resolution on an extension
  could be passed tomorrow but others suggested a special session
  would be convened to adopt the resolution after the association
  of tin producing countries meeting april 14 to 16.
the full council session resumes tomorrow at 1330 gmt after
  a european community coordination meeting at 1100.

  sell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, a
  staff member of the committee told reuters.
"they (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by being
  managed properly," said the staffer.
"management of the stockpile
  over the last 10 years has been atrocious."
responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to a
  white house agency, the federal emergency management agency.
the staffer said under the measures passed by the committee
  the secretary of defense would have more influence over
  decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials.
the administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrs
  worth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile.
the
  stockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.
he said several agencies currently helped fema to manage
  the stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.
these agencies included the office of management and budget
  and the departments of interior and commerce, he said.
the committee believed the shared involvement in stockpile
  management was counter-productive, he said.
canada trade rise seen as start of recovery
  canada's trade picture has brightened
  considerably, underscoring economists' predictions the sector
  would post a long awaited recovery this year.
the federal government reported today that the monthly
  surplus soared to 1.25 billion canadian dlrs in february,
  double january's 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than
  february 1986's 189 mln dlr tally.
"hopefully it's the beginning of a trend," said richardson
  greenshields of canada ltd economist susan clark in toronto.
economists generally don't expect such large gains over the
  next months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout the
  year.
"we thought the trade balance would improve ... over the
  year, and it certainly looks as if this morning's figure is
  indicative of that," commented economist james donegan at the
  toronto securities firm of midland doherty ltd.
      statistics canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23
  pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billion
  dls in the month.
"recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of
  exports up by 5.9 pct in february," the agency said in its
  monthly report.
total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85
  billion dlrs in february, while imports slipped to 9.19 billion
  dlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs.
economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end
  up three to five billion dlrs higher than last year's dismal
  10.1 billion dlr total.
in 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion
  dlrs.
money market analysts said the positive trade news touched
  off a modest rally in the canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85
  u.s. cts on north american markets early this morning after
  closing at 76.58 cts wednesday.
the currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early
  afternoon trading.
economists have been banking on an improved trade
  performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish
  canadian economy.
money market analysts said the positive trade news touched
  off a modest rally in the canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85
  u.s. cts on north american markets early this morning after
  closing at 76.58 cts wednesday.
the currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early
  afternoon trading.
economists have been banking on an improved trade
  performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish
  canadian economy.
they say the country's consumers, who have been spending at
  a torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays
  this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into
  the country.
meanwhile, demand for canadian exports in the united
  states, by far the country's largest market, is expected to be
  strong as a result of a projected rise in american consumer
  spending and the relatively low value of the canadian currency.
"we maintain what's going to drive canada's export
  performance is income growth in the u.s.," said midland's
  donegan.
but at the bank of nova scotia, deputy chief economist
  warren jestin was less optimistic about the u.s. outlook and
  said it could be a mistake to read too much into february's
  trade upturn.
jestin said, "given the fact the u.s. economy is showing
  signs of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate
  that part of the strength (in canada's trade figures) is
  probably transitory."
first bank &lt;fbs> sees loss on brazilian loans
  first bank systems inc, in reporting
  higher first quarter net, said that if interest is not paid on
  the 140 mln dlrs in brazilian loans and nine mln dlrs in
  ecuadorian loans for the rest of 1987, its profits for the
  entire year will be cut by 6.9 mln dlrs.
the banking firm said the non-performing status of these
  loans cut first quarter net by 1.7 mln dlrs.
earlier it reported first quarter profits of 57.4 mln dlrs
  or 95 cts a share, up from 46.6 mln dlrs or 80 cts a share in
  the year-ago period.
nonaccrual loans, restructured loans and other real estate
  were 637 mln dlrs, or 2.24 pct of total assets, compared to 514
  mln dlrs or 1.84 pct of assets at the end of 1986 and 636.1
  mln, or 2.46 pct of assets at march 31, 1986.
the provision for loan losses in the quarter was 35 mln
  dlrs, compared to 152.1 mln in the first quarter 1986, when
  there was a special addition to the reserve of 100 mln dlrs.
net charge offs were 34.7 mln, compared to 41.1 mln dlrs a year
  earlier.

clevite &lt;clev> amends rights plan
  clevite industries inc, which
  earlier received a 96 mln dlr takeover offer from j.p.
  industries inc &lt;jpi>, said it amended its shareholder rights
  plan so that certain provisions of the plan cannot occur until
  the board determines that it is in the best interests of the
  company and stockholders.
the plan, adopted in december 1986, permits clevite to
  issue shares at half price to existing stockholders and allows
  stockholders to buy shares of an unfriendly bidder at half
  price.
clevite said the amendments by its board effectively mean
  that the so-called flip-in and flip-over provisions of its
  rights plan can only be triggered by affirmative board
  approval.
the company said it acted inview of the proposed
  acquisition and because certain debt restrictions could block
  its ability to redeem the rights.

y-running bales.
the indicated totals include reported commitments to both
  named and unnamed destinations, sales on exporters' own account
  and optional origin sales plus actual exports already made
  during the respective marketing seasons.

  subject to modification, deferral or cancellation and it is
  unlikely that all reported quantities will be exported.
usda gave detailed breakdowns for the 1986/87 and 1987/88
  seasons as follows, in thousand tonnes unless stated --
   (a) - firm sales to a declared destination.
(b) - ultimate destination not yet declared.
(c) - sales made on exporters' own account.
(d) - exporter holds option to fill commitment with supplies 
  from origins other than u.s.
   (e) - accumulated exports since season began based on data 
  reported by exporters.
(f) - indicated total for season.
(g) - usda-projected exports for season.
note -- totals may not add due to rounding.

house panel wants pentagon manage u.s.
stockpile
  the house armed services committee
  has voted for a transfer in the management of stockpiled
  materials for national defense to the u.s. defense secretary.
the committee also voted for legally-binding quantity and
  quality requirements on the materials, mostly metals.
the measures are a part of the defense authorization bill
  which will be voted on in the house next month.
the purpose of the measures, passed by the committee
  yesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discourage
  sell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, a
  staff member of the committee told reuters.
"they (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by being
  managed properly," said the staffer.
"management of the stockpile
  over the last 10 years has been atrocious."
responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to a
  white house agency, the federal emergency management agency.
the staffer said that under the measures passed by the
  committee the secretary of defense would have more influence
  over decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials.
the administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrs
  worth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile.
the
  stockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.
he said several agencies currently helped fema to manage
  the stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.
these agencies included the office of management and budget
  and the departments of interior and commerce, he said.
the committee believed the shared involvement in stockpile
  management was counter-productive, he said.

soviet union to import more grain in 86/87-usda
  the u.s. agriculture department
  increased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the soviet
  union to 28 mln tonnes, up two mln tonnes from last month.
in its monthly report on the soviet grain situation, the
  usda said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because
  soviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last
  month.
usda said the increased purchasing is "somewhat surprising"
  because of recent higher soviet crop estimates.
all of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn,
  usda said.
of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12
  mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnes
  miscellaneous grains and pulses, usda said.
usda noted that the soviet winter grain crop suffered
  through a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed.
the severe winter "is believed to have resulted in above
  average winter-kill," usda said.
some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter losses
  maybe one reason why the soviet union has been actively buying
  grain recently.
usda said moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnes
  grain for delivery in 1986/87, including 14 mln tonnes wheat
  and 12 mln tonnes coarse grain.
disney family makes bid for holly sugar &lt;hly>
  the roy disney family disclosed in a
  filing with the securities and exchange commission that it made
  a bid to acquire holly sugar corp for a package of cash and
  securities.
shamrock holdings of california inc, a disney family
  company, said it submitted the bid on april 8 to salomon
  brothers inc, holly sugar's investment banker.
the offer was for 45 dlrs in cash, securities with a face
  value of 70 dlrs, and a "contingent payment certificate" that
  would pay out as much as 70 dlrs over a 20-year period for each
  share of holly sugar outstanding.
the disney family already holds 101,300 holly sugar shares
  or 9.0 pct of the total outstanding following purchases of
  12,500 shares march 13-april 17, shamrock told the sec.
shamrock said it had asked for certain information about
  holly sugar's financial condition but had been turned down.
it
  said its offer was therefore subject to further discussions.
"once we have had an opportunity to complete our due
  diligence evaluation of the company, including inspections of
  certain facilities and meetings with key management personnel,
  we would be prepared to negotiate all aspects of our proposal,
  including price," it said in its april 8 letter.

sony chairman forecasts lower profits this year
  sony corp &lt;sne.t> chairman akio
  morita said sony's profits would be sharply down in 1987 as a
  result of the dollar's decline.

  yen (290 million dollars) in 1986, 42.6 pct down on 1985's
  73.02 billion yen (506 million dollars).

  to recover from 1988 onwards.

usda florida orange report considered bearish
  the u.s. agriculture department's
  latest estimates on 1986/87 florida orange production and
  orange juice yield are bearish for the frozen concentrated
  orange juice futures market because the yield increase was
  greater than expected, fcoj traders and analysts said.
the usda projected an average yield of 1.50 gallons of fcoj
  per box versus last month's estimate of 1.47 gallons.
the government estimated florida orange production
  (excluding temples) at 122.9 mln boxes versus 124 mln last
  month.
temples were unchanged at 3.4 mln boxes.
traders and analysts said the unexpectedly large yield
  increase outweighed the anticipated drop in box count.

noranda begins salvage operations at murdochville
  &lt;noranda inc> said it began salvage
  operations at its murdochville, quebec, mine, where a fire last
  week killed one miner and caused 10 mln dlrs in damage.
another 56 miners were trapped underground for as long as
  24 hours before they were brought to safety.
noranda said the cause and full extent of the damage is
  still unknown but said it does know that the fire destroyed
  6,000 feet of conveyor belt.
noranda said work crews have begun securing the ramp
  leading into the zone where the fire was located.
the company
  said extreme heat from the fire caused severe rock degradation
  along several ramps and drifts in the mine.
noranda estimated that the securing operation for the zone
  will not be completed before the end of april.
noranda said the quebec health and safety commission, the
  quebec provincial police and noranda itself are each conducting
  an investigation into the fire.
production at the mine has been suspended until the
  investigations are complete.
the copper mine and smelter
  produced 72,000 tons of copper anodes in 1986 and employs 680
  people.
the smelter continues to operate with available
  concentrate from stockpiled supplies, noranda said.

u.s. oil dependency seen rising to record level
  the united states' dependency on
  foreign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s,
  according to john h. lichtblau, president of petroleum industry
  research associates.
lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference
  here, said the u.s. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much
  as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high
  level of 47 pct in 1977.
"the long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is
  inevitable," lichtblau said.
as much as 30 pct of u.s. oil
  imports in 1995 could come from opec nations, he said.
lichtblau said the u.s. depended on foreign suppliers for
  33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to
  40 pct by 1990.
"however, the rate of this growth can be affected
  positively or negatively through government action or
  inaction," lichtblau said.
he said that one of the government's negative actions is
  the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a
  disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash
  flow for oil exploration.
lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor
  price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.
"an international floor price adopted by all or most
  industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective
  measure and would be much less distortive for the u.s. than if
  we imposed it alone," lichtblau said.
development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic
  fuels as well as increased development in alaska could lessen
  u.s. dependency on foreign oil, lichtblau said.
a potential for alternative supplies could limit the
  willingness of opec nations to raise oil prices, he said.
lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer
  tax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the strategic
  petroleum reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans
  for alternative energy.

treasury's baker says system needs stability
  treasury secretary james baker said
  the floating exchange rate system has not been as effective as
  had been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalances
  from emerging in the global economy.
in remarks before the afternoon session of the
  international monetary fund's interim committee, baker said he
  was not suggesting that the system should be abandoned.
"but i do suggest," he said, "that we need something to give
  it more stability and to keep it headed in the right direction
  when the wind shifts."
he said that indicators can serve "as a kind of compass" but
  added that structural indicators can help focus attention on
  some policies.
baker, however, said the imf "needs to move beyond
  macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators that
  can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific
  relevance to the imbalances we face today."
the treasury secretary said that indicators should be given
  a more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- article
  iv consultations -- that the fund performs.
baker also told the policy making group that it was time
  for the imf to adopt earlier recommendations making imf
  surveillance more relevant to national policymakers and the
  public.
"in particular, we urge increased publicity for imf
  appraisals developed in article iv consultations, the use of
  follow-up reports on country actions to implement imf
  recommendations, and greater use of special consultation
  procedures," he said.
baker emphasized that indicators were a device "for moving
  beyond rhetoric to action."
he said they provide "more structure to the system, and
  induce more discipline and peer pressure into the process of
  policy coordination."
he said the fund's procedures for surveillance need to be
  reviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators.
"this should be matter of priority for the executive board,"
  he said.
baker also urged the fund to develop alternative
  medium-term economic scenarios for countries that "can help us
  focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, by
  identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the
  implications of these options."
he said also that further work should be done on finding
  paths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives.
"if we are to take effective remedial action when there are
  significant deviations from an intended course, then we must
  have more definitive ways of indentifying the right course for
  key variables," he said.
nerci &lt;ner> unit closes oil/gas acquisition
  nerco inc said its oil and gas

  mln dlrs in cash.
nerco said it estimates the field's total proved developed

u.s. dollar losses propel broad commodity gains
  commodities from gold to grains to
  cotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses
  in the u.s. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of
  inflation and economic instability.
gains were most pronounced on the commodity exchange in new
  york, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs a
  troy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.
a key factor behind the advance was anticipation that
  inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations
  to halt the slide in the value of the u.s. dollar, said steve
  chronowitz, director of commodity research with smith barney,
  harris upham and co., in new york.
the dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from
  the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their
  commitment to support its value, and despite reports of
  intervention by the u.s. federal reserve bank, traders said.
traders said it appears that the industrial nations, known
  as the group of seven, lack the ability to change the long-term
  direction of the currency markets.
"maybe they have some ideas or plans," said chronowitz.
"if
  they do, it's not evident."
"it looks like there's no cure but to let the free market
  take values to where they should be.
"one way or another, we will force our major trading
  partners to stimulate their economies," as a measure to correct
  the mounting u.s. trade deficit, chronowitz said.
"i think the markets believe, and have believed for a long
  time, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point.
it's
  going to be a long and tedious process, but that's what's
  happening," he said.
the falling value of the dollar makes u.s. commodities
  cheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.
at the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bonds
  saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning
  to commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said marty
  mcneill, a metals analyst in new york with the trading house of
  dominick and dominick.
the reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout
  the commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cotton
  posted broad gains.
traders at the chicago board of trade said attention in the
  grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome
  supplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate
  export demand.
after the close of trading, the agriculture department
  raised its estimate for grain imports by the soviet union by
  two mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.
live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the
  chicago mercantile exchange, while live cattle were moderately
  higher.
analysts said several factors boosted hog prices.
they said
  hogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal at
  this time of year, and farmers have been too busy with field
  work to market animals.

moore &lt;mcl> sees substantial 1987 profit gain
  moore corp ltd expects 1987 profits from

  1985 levels when the company earned 152 mln u.s. dlrs or 1.70
  dlrs a share, president m. keith goodrich said.
"we'll have a substantial increase in earnings from
  continuing operations," he told reporters after the annual
  meeting.
he said he expected profits would recover last year's
  lost ground and reach 1985 results.
in 1986, profits from continuing operations slumped to
  139.5 mln dlrs or 1.54 dlrs a share.
the total excluded losses
  of 30 mln dlrs on discontinued operations.
goodrich said moore is still actively looking for

  manufacturing or handling.
"we could do a large acquisition," he said when asked if
  the company could raise as much as one billion dlrs for this
  purpose.
chairman judson sinclair, answering a shareholder's
  question, told the annual meeting that a special resolution
  passed by shareholders to create a new class of preferred
  shares would allow moore to move quickly if it decided to
  pursue an acquisition.
"if we were to make a major acquisition ... it means we can
  move with a certain expediency," sinclair said.
asked if the resolution was designed to give moore
  protection from a possible hostile takeover, sinclair said
  only, "i know of no threat to the corporation at this time."

analysts doubt fed firmed despite borrowing rise
  economists said that they doubt the
  federal reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despite
  higher discount window borrowings in the latest two-week
  statement period and very heavy borrowings wednesday.
data out today show net borrowings from the fed averaged
  393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to wednesday, up from 265 mln
  dlrs in the prior statement period.
wednesday borrowings were
  1.4 billion dlrs as federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.
"one could make a case that the fed is firming, but it
  probably isn't," said william sullivan of dean witter reynolds.
sullivan said some may assume the fed has firmed policy
  modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the
  two-weeks to wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging
  around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.
however, the dean witter economist noted that the latest
  two-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand
  often pushes up borrrowings.
"some might argue that the fed was firming policy, but it
  looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions
  late in the statement period and didn't quite make it," said
  ward mccarthy of merrill lynch capital markets.
a fed spokesman told a press press conference today that
  the fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or
  more in its reserve projections in the week ended wednesday.
still, mccarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in
  its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer
  reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.
the fed took no market reserve management action last
  thursday and friday, the first two days of the week.
it added
  temporary reserves indirectly on monday via two billion dlrs of
  customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves
  directly via system repurchases on tuesday and wednesday.
based on fed data out today, economists calculated that the
  two-day system repurchase agreements the fed arrranged on
  tuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs.
they put wednesday's
  overnight system repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.
"it is quite clear that the fed is not firming policy at
  this time," said larry leuzzi of s.g. warburg and co inc.
citing the view shared by the other two economists, leuzzi
  said the fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest
  rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak
  economies in the united states and abroad and add to the
  financial stress of developing countries and their lenders.
"those who believe the fed tightened policy in the latest
  statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar
  tumbled," said mccarthy of merrill lynch.
he said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new
  statement period began today on disappointment yesterday's
  washington meetings of international monetary officials failed
  to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.
in fact, currency dealers said there was nothing in
  wednesday's g-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that
  the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade
  imbalance between the united states and japan.
the economists generally agreed that the fed is aiming for
  steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average
  fed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct.
this is about where
  the rate has been since early november.
"i'm not so sure that the fed is engineering a tighter
  policy to help the dollar, as some suspect," said sullivan of
  dean witter.
if it is, however, he said that fed probably has just
  nudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct from
  six to 6.10 pct previously.

u.s. markets offer glimpse of volcker nightmare
  today's turmoil in the u.s. financial
  markets, with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar's
  wake, is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that
  is likely to spell more turbulence ahead, economists said.
for two years, the markets had hailed the dollar's decline
  as the cure-all for the u.s. trade deficit.
interest rates fell
  sharply and wall street became a one-way street, up.
but that confidence is now cracking as the financial
  markets suddenly believe fed chairman paul volcker's
  often-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.
"volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollar
  freefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it," said
  david jones, economist at aubrey g. lanston and co inc.
the dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in
  40 years as the group of seven finance ministers in washington
  failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a
  credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short
  of further depreciation of the dollar.
bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid
  worries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scare
  away foreign investors and force the fed to tighten credit.
the inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12
  dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike
  in interest rates pulled the dow jones industrial average down
  by 33 points to 2339.
norman robertson, mellon bank chief economist, called the
  markets' instability frightening.
he believes economic
  fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that "once
  you start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop."
"there's a stark possibility that you could get a
  destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates
  and drives us into recession.
the markets are in a panic."
stephen marris of the institute for international economics
  in washington, has been warning for a long time that the
  controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and
  264 yen in february 1985 could turn into a nightmare.
"we're still more or less on track for a hard landing...
but
  the agony may be fairly drawn out," marris told reuters.
marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this
  year, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it
  would take very little to touch off what he calls the second
  phase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the
  dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.
the stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop on
  march 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.
the fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with
  historical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are
  not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its
  decline, marris said.
he has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.
marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latest
  weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks
  suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling
  below 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set as
  part of the g-7 paris agreement in february.
robertson at mellon, by contrast, said the loss of
  confidence was triggered last week when washington announced
  plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on japanese electronic
  imports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.
many economists believe that long-run stability will not
  return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is
  addressed - excessive consumption in the u.s., reflected in the
  massive budget deficit.
but in the short term, given the failure of the g-7 and of
  central bank intervention, some feel that the fed will have no
  choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.
"the only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a
  substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding
  cut abroad, at least by japan," said lanston's jones.
marris expects the fed to act quickly to raise interest
  rates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for
  american farmers, latin american governments and others.
but robert giordano, chief economist at goldman sachs and
  co, scoffed at the notion.
"it's ridiculous to think the federal
  reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak
  against just one currency.
this is yen strength, not dollar
  weakness," he said.
giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being
  made toward reducing the u.s. budget deficit.
"we're going to have one of the biggest reductions in the
  budget deficit relative to gnp in history this year, and nobody
  cares," he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69
  will have been greater.
he said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and
  thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.
but for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly that
  a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out.
"put on
  your helmets," giordano said.

japan has no plans to cut discount rate
  bank of japan sources said the bank
  has no plans to cut its discount rate.
they told reporters that there was no pressure on japan
  during the group of seven (g-7) meeting here yesterday to lower
  its discount rate.
they added that they themselves do not feel
  any need for a cut at all.
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson told reporters
  earlier today that some countries - those with strong
  currencies - might have to cut interest rates.
the bank of japan sources also said that it was too soon to
  call the g-7 pact a failure.
the central bank sources were commenting on the dollar's
  renewed tumble in new york and tokyo, which was sparked by
  remarks by u.s. treasury secretary james baker that the
  dollar's fall had been orderly.
they said the market must have misinterpreted baker's
  comments because he was referring to the dollar's fall since
  the plaza agreement in september 1985, over a long-time span,
  not the currency's recent movements.
they added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seize
  on anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way or
  the other.
the bank of japan sources said the u.s. is putting more
  weight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging market
  stability than on other currencies.
throughout the g-7 meeting, japan pointed to the dangers
  that would arise from a further dollar fall because it would
  reduce the flow of japanese capital to the u.s., hurting the
  u.s. and world economies, they said.
in february and in march of this year, japanese investors
  reduced their purchases of u.s. treasury bonds, the sources
  said.
each country in the g-7 - britain, canada, france, italy,
  japan, the u.s. and west germany - has a different view about
  currency stability, the bank of japan sources said.
this is because the overall foreign exchange market is a
  triangle of dollar/yen, european currencies/yen and
  dollar/european currencies.
at the time of the louvre agreement, european countries did
  not want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they did
  not object to the yen strengthening, they said.
australian unions and nsw government reach deal
  union and new south wales government
  officials have reached a compromise in a dispute over workers
  compensation, averting increased industrial action in the
  state, union sources said.
but some unions, including those of building and mining
  workers, said they were dissatisfied with the deal and would
  continue their strikes for a few more days.
state officials said the government had agreed to revise
  its proposals to cut compensation and would allow slightly
  higher cash benefits for injured workers.
under the original proposal, which sparked strikes and
  other industrial action in the state on april 7, workers'
  compensation would have been cut by one third.
full details of
  the compromise package are not yet known.
the labour council, affiliated to the australian council of
  trade unions (actu), had threatened to paralyse new south wales
  unless the government modified its pending legislation on the
  issue.
state officials said the only sectors affected in the past
  three days were some government building projects, railway
  freight movement and cargo handling in sydney's ports.
ecuador crude oil output to resume next month
  ecuador is due to resume limited crude oil
  output on may 8 when a new 43 km pipeline to neighbouring
  colombia should be finished, an energy ministry spokesman said.
oil output was halted on march 5 by an earthquake which
  damaged 50 km of the main pipeline linking jungle oilfields at
  lago agrio to the ecuadorean port of balao on the pacific.
about 13 km of the new link, capable of carrying some
  50,000 barrels per day (bpd), has been built, he said.
ecuador pumped 245,000 to 250,000 bpd before the
  earthquake.
the new link will connect lago agrio to puerto colon in
  colombia, the starting point of columbia's pipeline to the
  pacific ocean port of temuco.
the government estimates it will take about four more
  months to repair the lago agrio to balao pipeline and return
  output to normal levels, the spokesman said.
thai rice exports fall in week to april 7
  thailand exported 56,652 tonnes of rice
  in the week ended april 7, down from 75,160 tonnes the previous
  week, the commerce ministry said.
it said the government and private exporters shipped 41,607
  and 15,045 tonnes respectively.
private exporters concluded advance weekly sales for 48,062
  tonnes against 22,086 tonnes the previous week.
thailand exported 1.29 mln tonnes of rice so far in 1987,
  down from 1.39 mln tonnes a year ago.
it has commitments to export a further 353,045 tonnes this
  year.
japan sees marginal rise in edible oil demand
  the agriculture ministry estimates
  japan's edible oil demand will rise 1.5 pct in calendar 1987 to
  1.68 mln tonnes from 1.65 mln in 1986.
domestic consumption will rise to 1.66 mln tonnes in 1987
  from 1.64 mln in 1986, while imports will rise to 77,000 tonnes
  from 70,000 and exports will be unchanged at 14,000.
edible oil supplies will total 1.75 mln tonnes in 1987
  against 1.73 mln last year, including domestic output of 1.60
  mln against 1.55 mln.
domestic supplies will comprise 725,000
  of soybean oil (706,000 in 1986), 638,000 of rapeseed oil
  (609,000) and 235,000 of other origin oils (231,000).
interest rate differentials too small, banker says
  swiss national bank president pierre
  languetin said a wider interest rate differential between the
  dollar and stronger currencies was needed to brake the dollar's
  fall.
at a news conference, he said japan and west germany could
  try to stimulate their economies further by expanding money
  supply, but he added "i'm not so sure it would be desirable if
  monetary policy became more expansive.
"but what would be useful is a greater differential in
  interest rates," he said.
mobil australia reports 38.6 mln dlr 1986 loss
  wholly-owned mobil corp &lt;mob> unit,
  &lt;mobil oil australia ltd>, reported a 38.63 mln dlr net loss in
  1986, a turnaround from its 37.25 mln profit in 1985.
the loss reflected a combination of strikes plus scheduled
  and unscheduled refinery shutdowns for maintenance and
  inventory losses caused by government controls on both crude
  and product prices, mobil said in a statement.
however, equity-accounting of associates' profits reduced
  the loss to 24 mln dlrs against a 37 mln profit in 1985.
mobil said it was confident 1987 would see a return to
  profit as it built further on its 1985 company restructuring.
japan warns u.s.
it may retaliate in trade dispute
  japan warned the united states it may
  take retaliatory measures if the united states imposes its
  planned trade sanctions on april 17, a senior government
  official said.
shinji fukukawa, vice minister of the international trade
  and industry ministry, said in a statement japan would consider
  measures under the general agreement on tariffs and trade and
  other actions if the united states imposes 100 pct tariffs on
  some japanese exports as planned next week.
however, fukukawa said japan was ready to continue trade
  talks with the united states despite its failure to convince
  america to call off the threatened tariffs during two days of
  emergency talks which ended in washington yesterday.
last month president reagan announced the sanctions in
  retaliation for what he called japan's failure to honour a july
  1986 agreement to stop dumping computer microchips in markets
  outside the united states and to open its home market to
  american goods.
fukukawa said the united states had regrettably not
  listened to japan's explanation of its efforts to live up the
  pact and said washington had not given any detailed explanation
  of why it planned to impose the tariffs.
kuwait increases stake in sime darby
  the kuwait investment office (kio)
  has increased its stake in &lt;sime darby bhd> to 63.72 mln
  shares, representing 6.88 pct of sime darby's paid-up capital,
  from 60.7 mln shares, malayan banking bhd &lt;mbkm.si> said.
since last november, kio has been aggressively in the open
  market buying shares in sime darby, a major corporation with
  interests in insurance, property development, plantations and
  manufacturing.
the shares will be registered in the name of malayan
  banking subsidiary mayban (nominees) sdn bhd, with kio as the
  beneficial owner.
smuggling blamed for closure of haitian sugar firm
  a sugar mill which was this
  nation's second largest employer closed its doors yesterday,
  saying it had been run out of business by sugar smuggled from
  miami and the neighbouring dominican republic.
the closure of the haitian american sugar company (hasco)
  will idle 3,500 employees and affect as many as 30,000 to
  40,000 small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital,
  the company said.
"because of unprecedented and ever-growing smuggling, hasco
  regrets ...
it cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar cane
  after april 10," the mill warned planters earlier this week.
since president jean-claude duvalier fled haiti fourteen
  months ago, widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cooking
  oil, flour, rice, sugar and canned milk has lowered consumer
  prices but bankrupted several local manufacturers, throwing
  hundreds of thousands of haitians out of work.
at the hasco compound, where grim-faced workers lined up to
  receive their last pay, spokesman georges d. rigaud showed a
  warehouse stocked with an estimated 445,000 unsold 100-pound
  (45-kg) bags of sugar.
"we are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar.
we have no money left to continue operations," rigaud said.
he said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed an
  additional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers.
rigaud blamed the mill's problems on an order by duvalier
  two years ago forbidding hasco from refining sugar.
he said the government then began importing refined sugar
  at world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit and
  the provisional military-civilian government that replaced
  duvalier last year continued the policy.
"but now with all the smuggling even the state can't compete
  with smuggled dominican refined sugar," rigaud said.
hasco workers earned 4.20 dlrs daily, considerably above
  the usual minimum wage of three dlrs.
it is generally estimated that every employed haitian
  supports at least six people.
rigaud said hasco's closing at a
  minimum would affect 280,000 to 300,000 people.
laid-off workers were bitter about the closure.
"we're dead,
  and it's the government that's causing us to die," declared
  lucien felix, 34, who has five dependents.
taiwan announces new round of import tariff cuts
  taiwan announced plans for another round
  of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade
  talks with washington which officials described as a move to
  help balance trade with the united states.
wang der-hwa, deputy director of the finance ministry's
  customs administration department, told reporters the list of
  products included 60 items asked by washington.
"the move is part of our government efforts to encourage
  imports from our trading partners, particularly from the united
  states," he said.
he said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet
  that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles,
  apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut
  by between five and 50 pct.
the cabinet was expected to give its approval next thursday
  and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting
  on april 20, he added.
taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700
  foreign products last january aimed at helping reduce its
  growing trade surplus with the united states, the island's
  largest trading partner.
washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and
  pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade
  deficit with taipei.
washington's deficit with taipei rose to a record 13.6
  billion u.s. dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985.
it
  widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78
  billion a year earlier, taiwan's official figures show.
today's announcement came before a departure later today of
  a 15-member taiwan delegation for washington for a series of
  trade talks with u.s. officials.
the delegation's leader, vincent siew, told reporters last
  night he was leaving with "a heavy heart," meaning that he would
  face tough talks in washington because of rising protectionist
  sentiments in the u.s. congress.
taiwan's 1986 trade surplus
  with washington was the third largest, after japan and canada.
siew said the talks, starting on april 14, would cover u.s.
  calls for taiwan to open its market to american products,
  purchases of major u.s. machinery and power plant equipment,
  import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.
"i am afraid this time we have to give more than take from
  our talks with the u.s.," he said without elaborating.
british minister says he warned tokyo of sanctions
  a british minister said he had given the
  japanese government a clear warning of sanctions against
  japanese companies if tokyo did not allow more access to its
  internal markets "and it was clearly understood."
corporate affairs minister michael howard said on his
  return from a visit to japan he thought the japanese were
  beginning to appreciate the need to be "fair and open" about
  access to their own markets.
at an airport news conference howard denied opposition
  charges that his trip had been a failure because he had
  returned empty-handed.
"i did what i set out to do.
i was sent to deliver a clear
  message to the japanese government, and i delivered it very
  clearly, and it has been clearly understood."
howard said that under the financial services act the
  govenment had considerable flexibility in taking sanctions
  against japanese companies and finance houses operating in
  britain.
"it is not simply a question of withdrawing or refusing
  operating licences.
we can ban firms from certain countries
  from carrying out certain kinds of business, while allowing
  them to carry out other kinds."
"i hope we don't have to use these powers, but i made it
  clear in japan that if our timetable isn't met, we shall use
  them."
he said it would be unfortunate if britain and japan became
  involved in a tit-for-tat exchange, adding that japan gained
  more than anyone else from an open trading relationship.
"i think they are beginning to appreciate that if this
  relationship is to continue, it is very important for them to
  be fair and open about access to their own markets."
on the question of the british firm cable and wireless plc
  &lt;cawl.l>, which is trying to win a significant share of
  telecommunications contracts in japan, howard said he had told
  the japanese this was being widely regarded as a test case.
he said there were signs of movement on the case.
cable and
  wireless was due to take part in talks in japan next tuesday,
  he said.
earlier this week british prime minister margaret thatcher
  said britain could not go it alone on sanctions against japan,
  but would have to coordinate action with its european community
  partners.
community sources said after a meeting of trade officials
  yesterday that the group might impose steep new tariffs on a
  range of japanese goods to prevent diversion from united states
  markets if washington imposes trade sanctions against tokyo as
  it has threatened.
yield rises on 30-day sama deposits
  the yield on 30-day bankers security
  deposit accounts issued this week by the saudi arabian monetary
  agency (sama) rose by more than 1/8 point to 5.95913 pct from
  5.79348 a week ago, bankers said.
sama decreased the offer price on the 900 mln riyal issue
  to 99.50586 from 99.51953 last saturday.
like-dated interbank
  deposits were quoted today at 6-3/8, 1/8 pct -- 1/8 point
  higher than last saturday.
sama offers a total of 1.9 billion riyals in 30, 91 and
  180-day paper to banks in the kingdom each week.
uganda pulls out of coffee market - trade sources
  uganda's coffee marketing board (cmb)
  has stopped offering coffee on the international market because
  it is unhappy with current prices, coffee trade sources said.
the board suspended offerings last week but because of its
  urgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long it
  could sustain, the sources added.
hundreds of ugandan coffee farmers and processors have been
  waiting several months for payment from the cmb, which has had
  trouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to the
  kenyan port of mombasa.
foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis by
  holding up remittance of uganda's hard currency earnings from
  coffee exports, the government newspaper new vision said.
the banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee money
  and president yoweri museveni is thinking of imposing a penalty
  for such delays, it added.
banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was that
  commercial banks have lent the board only 77 billion shillings
  -- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in the
  current coffee year, while the government had asked for 100
  billion.
the cmb has 455,000 60-kg bags of coffee, about 15 pct of
  annual production, stockpiled in kampala awaiting shipment.
the crop accounts for over 90 pct of uganda's export
  earnings and the recent slide in prices to four-year lows is
  likely to more than offset an expected increase in production.
cmb officials have forecast that because the government has
  restored law and order in important growing areas, uganda will
  produce over three mln bags of coffee in the year ending
  september 30, about 25 pct more than in 1985/6.
w.german cocoa grind up 2.9 pct in first quarter
  the west german cocoa grind rose 2.9
  pct to 55,190 tonnes in the first quarter of 1987 from 53,643
  tonnes in the same quarter of of 1986, the bonn-based
  confectionery industry association said in a statement.

dry spell in philippines damages agriculture crops
  a prolonged dry spell has damaged
  111,350 hectares of rice and corn plantations in 10 provinces
  in the central and southern philippines, agriculture officials
  said.
they said some 71,070 tonnes of agricultural produce
  estimated at about 250 mln pesos was lost to the lack of
  rainfall.
they warned of a severe drought if the prevailing
  conditions continued until next month.
agriculture secretary carlos dominguez said he hoped the
  losses would be offset by the expected increase in output in
  other, normally more productive areas not affected by the dry
  spell.
affected were 14,030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice),
  representing a production loss of 22,250 tonnes valued at 77.8
  mln pesos, department of agriculture reports said.
about 48,820 tonnes of corn from 97,320 hectares valued at
  170.8 mln pesos have also been lost, they said.
officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has been
  hit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national total
  thus the damage is considered negligible.
in the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled by
  production from non-traditional corn farms which diversified
  into the cash crop from sugar two years ago.
the philippine coconut authority said coconut production
  in the major producing region of bicol might drop by 25 pct to
  320,000 tonnes if the dry spell continued.
there were no
  reports of actual damage.
spanish unemployment falls slightly in march
  spain's registered unemployment fell by
  10,465 people to 2.97 mln or 21.4 pct of the workforce in
  march, labour ministry figures show.
registered unemployment in february was 2.98 mln people, or
  21.5 pct of the workforce.
the figures were nonetheless higher than those for march
  1986 -- 2.8 mln people and 21 pct of the workforce.
hungary raises prices in effort to curb deficit
  hungary has announced sharp price
  increases for a range of food and consumer products as part of
  its efforts to curb a soaring budget deficit.
the official mti news agency said the government decided
  consumer price subsidies had to be cut to reduce state
  spending.
from today the price of meat will rise by an average
  18 pct and that of beer and spirits by 10 pct, mti said.
mti said consumer goods will also become more expensive,
  with the price of refrigerators rising some five pct.
it also
  announced a number of measures to ease hardship, including
  higher pensions and family allowances.
statistics indicate the budget deficit tripled in 1986 to
  47 billion forints.
central banker janos fekete has said the
  finance ministry is trying to cut the 1987 shortfall to between
  30 and 35 billion from a planned 43.8 billion.
a major tax reform, including the introduction of a
  western-style valued added tax, is planned for january 1988 in
  an effort to cure problems in state spending.
but diplomats said the latest announcement shows the
  authorities were forced to act quickly to keep this year's
  deficit under control.
the measures are also aimed at cooling an overheated
  economy, and could help dampen hungarians' appetite for
  imported western goods which consume increasingly expensive
  hard currency, the diplomats said.
the diplomats also said, however, that they did not expect
  the kind of social unrest that followed sharp price rises in
  other east bloc states, notably poland.

china wants to buy 5,000 tonnes pakistani cotton
  china is negotiating with pakistan to
  buy 5,000 tonnes of cotton this year, after importing the same
  amount last year under a barter agreement, chinese consulate
  sources said.
chinese ambassador tian ding told a meeting of pakistani
  industrialists on thursday that china intended to increase
  imports from pakistan to reduce a trade imbalance.
pakistani officials estimate the country's cotton output
  from the current crop at a record 7.6 mln bales (375 pounds
  each).
last year's output totalled 7.2 mln bales and domestic
  consumption was just below three mln bales, they said.
australian government must cut spending, anz says
  the government must announce harsh cuts
  in spending in its may 14 economic statement if it is to give
  an adequate response to australia's economic problems, the anz
  banking group ltd &lt;anza.s> said.
cuts of two billion dlrs would be insufficient against the
  backdrop of a 12 billion dlr government deficit and a 14
  billion dlr current account deficit, it said in its monthly
  business indicators publication.
"for the past two years, the government has struggled with
  an economic reality that demands measures beyond those which it
  sees as politically practicable," it said.
the political climate meant there would be a continued
  over-reliance on monetary policy to hold the exchange rate and
  maintain confidence in economic management, anz said.
"the cost of this approach is that the much-needed revival
  of business investment will be further postponed," it said.
the economy was now on a modest growth upswing boosted by
  export and import-replacement industries which had created a
  false suggestion that the worst adjustments to the balance of
  payments crisis were past.
"unfortunately, successful adjustment
  to australia's deep-seated economic problems remains a
  long-term process," it said.
in its economic forecasts, anz said it expected moderate
  overall economic growth with gross domestic product (gdp)
  rising 2.7 pct this year and 2.4 pct in 1988.
the current account deficit would narrow to five pct of gdp
  this year and 4.3 pct in 1988 and net foreign debt would grow
  strongly from 81 billion at the end of 1986 to 97.2 billion at
  end-1987 and 110.3 billion a year later.
inflation would fall to 8.5 pct in 1987 and 7.5 pct in 1988
  from 8.9 pct in 1986 and further falls in real wages were
  expected, anz said.
electrolytic refining lowers copper price
  the electrolytic refining and

japan central bank actively buys dollars in tokyo
  the bank of japan actively bought dollars
  here in early afternoon trade at around 142.20 yen, dealers
  said.
the central bank had placed buy orders at that level and
  prevented the dollar from falling when it came under heavy
  selling pressure from investment trusts and trading houses,
  they said.
however, the intervention failed to boost the u.s. currency
  significantly from the 142.20 yen level, they added.
the dollar was trading around its midday rate of 142.30
  yen.
it had opened here at 141.85 yen.
texaco sees business little hit by bankruptcy move
  texaco inc &lt;tx> said its decision to
  file for protection under chapter 11 of the u.s. bankruptcy
  code will not affect the majority of its businesses.
it said its subsidiaries, which account for 96 pct of its
  32.6 billion dlrs in revenues and 79 pct of its net property,
  plant and equipment, were free of the action.
only parent holding company, texaco inc, and operating
  subsidiaries, texaco capital inc and texaco capital n.v, are
  affected, it said.
but the company said it was likely to suspend its 75 cents
  per share quarterly common stock dividend and halt repayments
  on debts of some 6.8 billion dlrs.
texaco said it filed for chaper 11 because suppliers were
  demanding cash payments and banks were withholding loans as a
  result of a legal dispute with pennzoil co &lt;pzl>.
texaco is fighting a texas law requiring it to post a bond
  of more than 10 billion dlrs before it can appeal a 1985
  judgment that ruled it illegally interfered with pennzoil's
  1984 acquisition of getty petroleum corp &lt;gty>.
the bond almost
  matches the damages awarded against texaco.
should texaco fail to place the bond, pennzoil could begin
  to attach its assets to secure the judgment.
last monday, the supreme court overturned a decision to cut
  texaco's bond to one billion dlrs, and sent the issue back to
  the texas courts.
analysts said the bankruptcy filing effectively froze all
  texaco's obligations while it continued to appeal the merits of
  the pennzoil lawsuit.
"attempts last week to win a compromise on both the bond
  issue and the larger dispute failed," james kinnear, texaco's
  president and chief executive officer, told reporters.
kinnear said pennzoil's disclosure in court papers on
  friday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing until
  the end of april, pushed texaco further towards chapter 11.
pennzoil had asked texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cash
  bond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct of
  earnings.
pennzoil also wanted assurances that texaco would not
  sell any assets, kinnear said.
texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter of
  credit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under
  11.1 billion dlrs, he added.
joseph jamail, a houston attorney for pennzoil, said the
  company had made its latest settlement offer to texaco on
  saturday and was taken by surprise when texaco filed for
  bankruptcy.
he declined to reveal the amount of the proposal, citing a
  confidentiality agreement between the two companies.
"texaco
  told us they would get back to us but instead they chose to go
  to bankruptcy court," jamail said.
attorneys for pennzoil said they believed the company would
  prevail in court appeals, adding that texaco's assets were
  ample ultimately to pay the pennzoil judgment in full.
paton reports u.s. green coffee roastings higher
  u.s. roastings of green coffee in the
  week ended april 4 were about 275,000 (60-kilo) bags, including
  that used for soluble production, compared with 215,000 bags in
  the corresponding week of last year and about 320,000 bags in
  the week ended march 28, george gordon paton and co inc
  reported.
it said cumulative roastings for calendar 1987 now total
  4,440,000 bags, compared with 4,540,000 bags by this time last
  year.
western mining sells acm stake
  western mining corp holdings ltd
  &lt;wmng.s> (wmc) said it sold its entire holding of 22.13 mln
  shares in the gold mining company &lt;australian consolidated
  minerals ltd> (acm).
wmc gave no details, but stockbrokers said the sale was
  made at eight dlrs a share on friday to a number of u.s.,
  european and australian investors through wmc's usual brokers.
the company purchased the 19.9 pct parcel in early march
  from amax inc &lt;amx.n> at 6.32 dlrs a share ahead of a
  one-for-three bonus issue when amax sold its entire 47 pct
  stake in acm to a number of local companies.
yugoslav economy worsened in 1986, bank data shows
  national bank economic data for 1986
  shows that yugoslavia's trade deficit grew, the inflation rate
  rose, wages were sharply higher, the money supply expanded and
  the value of the dinar fell.
the trade deficit for 1986 was 2.012 billion dlrs, 25.7 pct
  higher than in 1985.
the trend continued in the first three
  months of this year as exports dropped by 17.8 pct, in hard
  currency terms, to 2.124 billion dlrs.
yugoslavia this year started quoting trade figures in
  dinars based on current exchange rates, instead of dollars
  based on a fixed exchange rate of 264.53 dinars per dollar.
yugoslavia's balance of payments surplus with the
  convertible currency area fell to 245 mln dlrs in 1986 from 344
  mln in 1985.
the national bank said the drop was due to a
  deterioration in trade.
exports to the convertible currency
  area rose 11.6 pct from 1985, while imports rose 17.8 pct.
retail prices rose an average of 88.1 pct in 1986 while
  industrial producer prices rose by 70.6 pct, the bank's data
  showed.
the cost of living rose by 89.1 pct.
personal incomes rose by 109 pct in 1986.
prime minister branko mikulic warned in february that wages
  were too high given the level of productivity.
mikulic introduced a law cutting wages to the level of the
  last quarter of 1986 and tying future rises to productivity.
bank statistics show the overall 1986 rise in m-1 money
  supply was 109.1 pct with a year-end position of 3,895.9
  billion dinars.
yugoslavs have 9.8 billion dlrs worth of
  foreign currency savings in the country and 20 billion dlrs
  abroad, mostly owned by workers employed in western europe.
the dinar fell by 73.1 pct against a basket of hard
  currencies in 1986.
the highest depreciation was against the
  swiss franc, 85.3 pct, and the lowest against the u.s. dollar,
  46.2 pct.
anz bank sets one-for-two bonus issue
  australia and new zealand banking
  group ltd &lt;anza.s> said it will make a one-for-two bonus issue
  from its asset revaluation reserve to shareholders registered
  june 2.
the proposed bonus and an increase in authorised capital to
  one billion one-dlr par shares from 600 mln will be put to
  shareholders for approval at an extraordinary general meeting
  on may 26, the anz said in a statement.
the issue will absorb about 230 mln dlrs of the 260.9 mln
  standing in the asset revaluation reserve, it said.
the bank said that by lowering the dividend rate it expects
  to maintain the value of dividend payout on the enlarged
  capital at about the level of its last full year ended
  september 30.
the group paid 31 cents a share and 133.1 mln
  dlrs in all for that year.
shareholders will also be asked to approve changes in the
  bank's articles of association to allow it to offer shares in
  lieu of the interim dividend at a discount of five pct to the
  market price.
the group is the latest to announce a tax-free bonus issue
  ahead of dividend imputation, effective july 1.
uae central bank cd yields rise

china sulphur-iron mine starts production
  china's largest sulphur-iron mine has

  processing because of its high quality.
china, chile to build copper tube plant in china
  china's state-owned beijing non-ferrous
  metals industrial corp and &lt;wrought copper ltd> of chile signed
  a contract to jointly build a copper tube plant on the
  outskirts of peking, the china daily said.
the beijing-santiago copper tube co involves an investment
  of 9.93 mln dlrs and will, on completion, have a production
  capacity of 5,000 tonnes of copper tubes a year, it said.
it said chile will supply copper at preferential rates to
  the venture, whose equipment comes from &lt;wednesbury tube co> of
  u.k.
the agreement calls for joint sino-chilean management of
  the venture for 15 years, the paper said.
it said the venture is the first economic cooperation
  project between china and chile, but gave no more details.
china is a major copper importer.
customs figures show it
  imported 171,118 tonnes of copper and alloy in calendar 1986,
  down from 355,652 tonnes in 1985.
singapore external trade gains 8.8 pct in quarter
  singapore's external trade grew 8.8
  pct in first quarter 1987, against a 12.4 pct decline in the
  same period last year and two pct growth in the previous
  quarter, the trade development board said.
it said exports over the period rose by 8.7 pct to 12.38
  billion dlrs and imports by 8.9 pct to 14.64 billion for a
  trade deficit of 2.26 billion, against a 2.06 billion deficit
  in the same 1986 period and 1.78 billion deficit previously.
the growth was attributed to the strength of non-oil trade,
  especially computers and computer parts, electronic components
  and garments, it said.
malaysia's 1986 manufacturing exports rise 24 pct
  malaysia's manufacturing exports
  rose by 24.5 pct to 15.1 billion ringgit in 1986, chairman of
  the export promotion council ahmad sarji abdul hamind said.
the improved export performance was led by electrical and
  electronic products, textiles, footwear, clothing, processed
  food, timber, chemical and rubber products, he told a news
  conference.
however, total gross exports for the year declined by 5.6
  pct to 35.9 billion ringgit from 38 billion in 1985 due to a
  fall in major commodity exports and weak prices, he said.
offer for dome may short-circuit its debt talks
  a 3.22 billion dlr offer for dome
  petroleum ltd &lt;dmp.mo> by transcanada pipelines ltd &lt;trp.to>
  may short-circuit dome's restructuring plan and open the door
  for more takeover bids, oil analysts said.
dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt
  of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by july 1, 1987, when an interim
  debt plan that allowed the canadian oil and gas firm to defer
  substantial payments to creditors will expire.
analysts said transcanada's bid signals dome's debtholders
  that an alternative exists to dome's debt plan.
dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as
  public noteholders in march after several months of delicate
  negotiations.
transcanada's proposal "amounts to a quasi debt
  restructuring," oil analyst doug gowland of brown baldwin nisker
  ltd said from toronto.
calgary-based dome's restructuring plan would allow
  creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet
  to be negotiated.
payments on remaining debt would be linked to
  cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.
"the weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that
  even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that
  dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,"
  said wilf gobert, an oil analyst for peters and co ltd in
  calgary.
transcanada's announcement came as a surprise since dome
  was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed
  refinancing packages, gobert said.
the transcanada proposal could open the bidding for dome
  since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders
  to agree to a restructuring, he added.
"i would think that the debtholders would want to entertain
  any and all offers (for dome)," gobert said.
dome spokesman david annesley said in new york that
  transcanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix
  the bidding price for dome and an effort to preclude other
  possible buyers from making an offer.
"by drawing attention to
  us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little
  reluctant to come forward," he said.
dome does not consider transcanada's proposal a formal
  offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a
  confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.
dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions
  with transcanada in order to pursue talks with other
  unidentified parties.
however, dome said its management and
  financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including
  transcanada's.
gowland said transcanada's offer is probably a fair price
  for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.
however, he said not enough financial details are known
  about dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of
  transcanada's proposed offer.
u.k. money market deficit forecast at 400 mln stg
  the bank of england said it forecast a
  shortage of around 400 mln stg in the money market today.
among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
  in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
  some 1.085 billion stg.
partly offsetting these outflows, a fall in note
  circulation will add some 340 mln stg, exchequer transactions
  around 300 mln and bankers' balances above target about 50 mln.

trade issues straining ec's patience with japan
  member states of the european
  community are starting to run out of patience with japan which
  they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open
  its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.
diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by ec
  countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the
  willingness, or at least the ability, of the japanese
  government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the ec.
however, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as
  ec states know they would suffer almost as much as japan.
senior ec diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to
  an ec executive commission proposal under which the ec could
  raise tariffs on a range of japanese products if the u.s.
carries out a threat to make a similar move on april 17.
the ec tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations
  entered into with the world trade body gatt, would be designed
  to stop a diversion of exports to the ec market from that of
  the u.s.
the diplomats were meeting as tokyo announced that the ec's
  trade deficit with japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in
  march, up from 1.94 billion in february.
in 1986, japanese exports to the ec totalled 30.67 billion
  dlrs, up 4.5 pct from 1985, while ec exports to japan fell one
  pct to 12.43 billion dlrs.
in paris, trade minister michel noir said france has
  decided to give japan a taste of its own medicine.
burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozen
  coquilles st jacques will be restricted by a strict application
  of french quality standards -- something ec states say often
  happens to their own exports entering japan.
britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of japanese
  banks and insurance companies to operate in the city of london,
  because the british cable and wireless company lost out in
  competition for a japanese telecommucations contract.
however, british officials in london have said that the
  government may have gone too far in implying that it would take
  immediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened.
by contrast, west germany, with the ec's most successful
  economy, has never threatened tokyo with sanctions, preferring
  to rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own
  industries to surmount obstacles to export to japan.
the ec commission itself has switched its tactics in recent
  years, substituting general calls for action by japan to open
  its market with specific demands for moves in key areas.
at present, it is, for instance, pressuring japan to end
  allegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and
  spirits, to ensure ec companies have a chance to win contracts
  for the building of a new international airport, and to
  simplify certification and safety checks on imported cars.
ec officials say these tactics yield some benefits, but
  often the japanese announce modifications of their non-tariff
  barriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount.
they stress, however, that any action must be taken by the
  ec as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action.
one of the problems britain could face if it were to
  withdraw licences for japanese banks would be that the bankers
  would be welcomed with open arms in frankfurt or amsterdam,
  they point out.
morgan crucible says prospects are encouraging
  morgan crucible co plc &lt;mgcr.l> said the
  prospects for 1987 were encouraging, with orders and sales
  significantly up on last year in all divisions.
it said there were good opportunities for growth in both
  existing and recently acquired businesses as well as for growth
  by acquisition in related areas.
it earlier announced a 6.1 mln stg rise in pre-tax profit
  to 24.8 mln stg for the year to december 28.
turnover rose to
  242.1 mln from 211.5 mln.
most of its companies performed well despite a slowdown in
  the u.s., u.k. and australian economies in the first half.
currency fluctuations reduced pretax profit by around one
  mln stg, it noted.
morgan said although profits in the electronics sector
  improved to 1.0 mln stg from 100,000 stg previously, results
  were nonetheless disappointing.
sales were lower than expected, due mainly to delayed
  defence orders and cancellations.
however, it said it had taken
  the necessary remedial action, obtained new business and was
  now proceeding with the delivery of major delayed orders.
morgan shares firmed two pence to 318p at 0905 gmt from

swedish industrial production rises sharply
  swedish industrial production rose
  2.6 pct in february, after a 1.8 pct fall in january, showing a
  4.4 pct rise over february 1986 and reaching its highest level

the rise reflected recovery in almost all sectors after an
  exceptionally cold spell in january, the bureau said, adding
  that the highest rises were seen in the forest, chemical and
  metal industries.
kenya devalues shilling by 0.6 pct against sdr
  kenya devalued the shilling by 0.6 pct
  against the special drawing right (sdr) in response to the
  decline of the dollar last last week, bankers said.
the central bank of kenya set the shilling at 20.7449 to
  the sdr compared with the 20.6226 rate in force since the last
  devaluation on march 31.
the kenyan shilling has lost 5.6 pct of its value against
  the sdr this year in a series of devaluations designed to keep
  the value of the dollar above 16 shillings.
awb chairman urges farmers not to cut plantings
  australia could lose valuable wheat
  markets through lack of availability if plantings for the
  coming 1987/88 season are significantly reduced, australian
  wheat board (awb) chairman clinton condon said.
"if predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings prove
  true, australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of its
  valuable markets," he said in a statement.
condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an awb
  spokesman said there was a general industry feeling that
  farmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cut
  back plantings sharply.
wheat sowing normally begins in may.
however, condon said he did not believe plantings would be
  cut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers were
  facing enormous financial pressures.
he said the awb expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mln
  hectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about
  16 mln tonnes.
final crop estimates for 1986/87 and planting
  intentions for 1987/88 are not yet available.
if the awb is unable, because of a short-term cut in
  plantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developed
  with much time and effort, it may have great difficulty selling
  wheat to those markets in the future, condon said.
"markets which rely on a steady supply of australian wheat
  understand a decrease in production due to drought but they
  will have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision to
  decrease production," condon said.
"if australia wants wheat to continue as a major export
  income earner, governments and government authorities will need
  to closely examine ways of contributing to the continuing
  viability of the wheat industry," he added.
australia's leading wheat markets include china, egypt,
  iran, iraq, the soviet union and japan.
williams details acceptances of norcros offer

  pct, and 180,240 preference shares, or 8.19 pct.
before the 568 mln stg contested bid was launched last
  month, williams held 850,000 ordinary shares, or 0.67 pct and
  since then it had acquired options to buy a further 1.99 mln or

dutch feed compounder starts case against ec levy
  a major animal feed producer, cehave
  nv veghel (chv), has begun legal proceedings against the
  application of the european community grain co-responsibility
  levy, with the full backing of the dutch animal grain and feed
  trade association, het comite, association chief executive
  peter pex told reuters.
oral proceedings were held in the hague on friday and the
  court said it would give its verdict within six weeks.
"however,
  that is the normal wording and we expect the hague court to
  refer questions on the interpretation and application of the
  levy to the european court of justice in luxembourg," pex added.
het comite claims the way the levy is applied does not take
  account of currency cross-rates of exchange and can mean a
  compounder in one country being asked to pay a higher levy in
  its own national currency than it received down the chain from
  the original producer of the grain.
"we would like the business administration court in the
  hague to ask the luxembourg court of justice not only whether
  the dutch grain commodity board, the levy collection agency,
  has interpreted the levy regulations correctly, but also
  whether the regulations themselves may contravene european law,"
  pex said.
"it is only with great regret that we have taken this route,
  but we have had no political help, and therefore have no option
  even though it could take years," pex added.
het comite asked chv to act as a test case against the
  grain levy because the bill the company received from the
  commodity board included grain from a wide variety of origins
  and was therefore considered to be the best general basis for a
  legal challenge to the levy, pex noted.
het comite's actions will run in tandem with questions on
  the levy already posed to the luxembourg court in a case
  brought by the association of european animal feed
  manufacturers, fefac.
china raises grain purchase prices
  china has raised the state purchase
  prices of corn, rice, cottonseed and shelled peanuts from april
  1 to encourage farmers to grow them, the official china
  commercial daily said.
the paper said the price paid for corn from 14 northern
  provinces, cities and regions has increased by one yuan per 50
  kg.
a foreign agricultural expert said the rise will take the
  price to 17 fen per jin (0.5 kg) from 16 fen.
the paper said the price for long-grained rice from 10
  southern provinces and cities was raised by 1.5 yuan per 50 kg.
the paper said the price for round-grained rice from 11
  provinces, regions and cities in central, east and northwest
  china has been increased by 1.75 yuan per 50 kg.
it gave no
  more price details.
it said local authorities must inform farmers of the price
  increases before farmers begin planting, to encourage
  production of grains and oilseeds.
chinese officials have said farmers are unwilling to grow
  grain because they can earn more from other crops.
west german cocoa grindings within expectations
  west german first quarter cocoa
  grindings, which rose 2.9 pct from the same 1986 quarter, were
  within expectations, trade sources said.
they described the results, announced saturday, as normal
  and unspectacular, considering that the grind in the fourth
  quarter was rather high and some was carried over into the
  first quarter.
grindings rose to 55,190 tonnes from 53,643 in the first
  1986 quarter.
a spokesman for the confectionery industry
  association said that west german grindings are expected to
  stay relatively high in comparison to other west european
  countries.

commonwealth bank cuts australia prime to 17.5 pct
  the commonwealth bank of australia said
  it will lower its prime lending rate to 17.5 pct from 18.25,
  effective april 15.
the bank's new rate will be the lowest of australia's
  current prime rates.

merlin also has a 12.5 pct stake in the adjacent papuan
  basin permit, ppl-18, which contains the juha gas and
  condensate discovery.
in addition to papua new guinea, merlin has petroleum
  exploration and production interests in the u.s., bond added.
institutes divided on outlook for german economy
  the five leading west german economic
  research institutes have failed to agree about how strongly the
  domestic economy will expand this year but revised down
  forecasts contained in a report published six months ago.
the three research groups of kiel, hamburg and essen
  predicted in the institutes' joint spring report that gross
  national product (gnp) would rise by two pct in 1987, compared
  with 2.4 pct in 1986.
the five institutes had jointly forecast
  three pct 1987 growth in october last year.
taking a dissenting view, the diw institute of west berlin
  and munich's ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.
the joint report said that the estimates of economic
  development made by the diw and ifo were "markedly less
  favourable" than those of the other three.
the diw and ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a
  slow start to the year.
"in the second half of 1987 there will,
  however, only be a weak upward movement," they said.
the two institutes said external economic factors which
  were currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would
  dominate the economic environment throughout the year.
they saw
  exports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted no
  marked improvement in the course of the year.
the other three institutes, however, wrote: "the decline in
  demand and production (seen) in the winter months does not
  indicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing."
they said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate
  uncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans.
but they expected that many investments had not been cancelled
  but only put off.
"it can be presumed that the braking actions
  (on the economy) will diminish markedly this year."
they added: "the domestic prerequisites for a continuation
  of the economic uptrend are still favourable."
these three institutes said diminishing external burdens
  combined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in
  demand and production could be expected by the spring.
however, this projection was clouded by risks including the
  further development of the mark against the dollar.
contrary to the diw and ifo, the three institutes said that
  while exports would continue to be the weak point of the
  economy in 1987, "there is good reason to believe that exports
  will soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during
  the course of the year."
they predicted an overall 0.5 pct fall
  in exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.
the three more positive institutes saw private consumption
  rising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986,
  while diw and ifo predicted a three pct increase.
they saw the climate for equipment investment improving but
  predicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in
  1986.
ifo and diw saw these investments rising by only two pct.
all the institutes predicted only a slight decline in
  unemployment.
the kiel, hamburg and essen institutes said the
  jobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23
  mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in
  work of about 200,000.
these three institutes said new jobs would be created
  mainly in the private services sector and also by the state in
  the context of job creation measures.
the construction industry
  was likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980
  but they predicted either no rise in employment in the
  manufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.
the diw and ifo said rises in employment would occur only
  in the tertiary sector, while "the number employed in the
  manufacturing industry will decline."
the diw and ifo said unemployment would only decline to
  2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.
they saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58
  billion marks from 78 billion in 1986.
the other three saw a
  current account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marks
  and predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around
  100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986.
the institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to
  rise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all five
  predicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct.
blue arrow to buy u.s. richards companies
  &lt;blue arrow plc> said it had agreed
  terms to acquire a group of u.s. companies collectively known
  as the &lt;richards companies>, which specialise in executive
  recruitment and management consultancy on personnel matters.
the total consideration will be 29 mln u.s. dlrs of which
  50 pct will be payable in cash and 50 pct by the issue of 1.36
  mln new ordinary shares in blue arrow.
the richard companies made a pre-tax profit of 3.6 mln dlrs
  in the year to end-1986, on turnover of 7.1 mln dlrs with net
  tangible assets at the end of 1986 of 3.4 mln dlrs.
blue arrow shares were trading 9p lower at 670 this
  morning.
saudi riyal deposits surge on u.s. rate rise
  saudi riyal interbank deposit rates
  surged across the board as banks tried to build long positions
  in anticipation of a further rise in u.s. interest rates,
  dealers said.
they said traders expected riyal deposits to follow the
  recent strong rise in eurodollar rates sparked by fears of a
  tighter u.s. monetary policy to halt the dollar's slide.
"there was a wave of panic buying early in the morning as
  people tried to cover gaps and build long riyal positions," said
  one dealer.
as a result, riyal deposits were strongly bid and
  traders scrambled for any available offers.
one-way trade focused mainly on the fixed periods but short
  dates also rose, dealers said.
spot-next and one-week deposits
  climbed to 6-5/8, 1/8 pct from 6-3/8, six on sunday.
one-month deposits rose to 6-1/2, 3/8 pct from 6-1/4, six
  and three-month deposits climbed to 6-3/4, 5/8 pct from 6-9/16,
  7/16.
six-month deposits also firmed to 7-1/8, seven pct from
  7-1/16, 6-7/8 on sunday.
the spot riyal was steady at 3.7500/03 to the dollar after
  quotes of 3.7498/7503 yesterday.
london gold morning fix highest since october
  gold bullion continued to move higher
  supported by good general buying and was fixed this morning at
  436.50 dlrs, 268.368 stg, an ounce, up from friday's close of
  432.00/50, dealers said.
the setting was the highest since october 8 as gold built
  on friday's gains, which had been based on the weakness of the
  dollar and fears of a trade war between the united states and
  japan.
it opened slightly firmer at 433.50/434.00 and moved up
  steadily during the morning supported by commission house and
  trade buying, dealers said.
dealers said there was resistance around 440.00 but with
  sentiment still firm some traders believe the rally may even
  take gold as high as 500 dlrs.
platinum was fixed this morning at 583.50 dlrs an ounce, up
  from friday's close of 578.50/580.50, and also the highest
  setting since october.
borg-warner agrees to buyout by merrill lynch firm
  borg-warner &lt;bor> corp, facing an
  unwanted offer from gaf corp &lt;gaf>, agreed to a 4.23 billion
  dlr buyout offer from a company to be formed by &lt;merrill lynch
  capital partners inc>.
borg-warner and merrill said yesterday they entered a
  definitive merger agreement, under which a subsidiary of the
  new company, &lt;av holdings corp>, will begin a 48.50 dlr per
  share cash tender offer today for 77.6 mln shares or 89 pct of
  borg-warner common stock.
the offer will be followed by a merger in which each
  remaining share will be converted into 19.75 dlrs cash and
  54.25 dlrs principal amount of av holdings junior subordinated
  discount debentures.
as a result of the merger, borg-warner will become a wholly
  owned subsidiary of av holdings.
a borg-warner spokeswoman said
  members of management do not plan to participate in the
  transaction, but they will retain their positions with the
  company.
a spokesman for gaf was unavailable for comment.
gaf holds
  19.9 pct of borg-warner's shares.
gaf had said it would offer 46 dlrs per share.
borg-warner's spokeswoman said the company still plans to
  sell its financial services unit, which includes wells fargo
  security guards, and the chilton corp, a credit rating service.
borg-warner has been the focus of takeover speculation for
  about a year.
corporate raider irwin jacobs last year proposed
  a takeover of the firm and until recently held 10 pct of the
  stock.
following the gaf offer, analysts had calculated breakup
  values for the company in the low 50 dlrs per share range and
  speculated an offer would have to be sweetened.
in its statement, borg-warner said its board endorsed the
  merrill offer and it recommended that shareholders tender their
  shares.
the board received opinions on the offer from its
  advisors, first boston corp and goldman, sachs and co.
      james burke, president of merrill lynch capital partners,
  said, "we are very pleased to have entered into this transaction
  with borg-warner.
we are looking forward to working with the
  employees of borg-warner and to borg-warner maintaining its
  strong presence in the chicago community."
merrill lynch will be the dealer-manager for the offer,
  which expires at midnight edt may 8 (0400 gmt, may 9), subject
  to conditions, including the completion of necessary financing
  arrangements.
the offer is also subject to a minimum 44.25 mln shares, or
  51 pct of the outstanding shares, being tendered.
merrill lynch and certain affiliates have committed to
  provide 200 mln dlrs in av holdings equity and 870 mln in
  subordinated financing and forward underwriting commitments.
merrill lynch said that following discussions with
  commercial banks it is confident it can obtain the rest of the
  financing required to complete the transaction.
the junior subordinated discount debentures to be issued in
  the merger will carry a 13 pct coupon and will begin paying
  cash interest after five years.
the debentures will be redeemable at the company's option
  for the first six years at 105 pct, during the seventh year at
  102.5 pct and after that at 100 pct of the principal amount.
the junior subordinated discount debentures have a maturity
  of 20 years and are entitled to a sinking fund commencing in
  the 16th year designed to retire 60 pct of the issue before
  maturity.
borg-warner will also redeem all of its outstanding 4.50
  dlrs cumulative preferred stock, series a, for 100 dlrs per
  share.
holders who wish to participate in the offer must first
  convert their preferred stock into borg-warner common stock.
the board of borg-warner has also taken steps to redeem its
  poison pill or share purchase rights for five cents per right,
  effective immediately.
u.k. march producer prices rise 0.3 pct
  the price index for sales of
  manufactured goods in the u.k. rose a provisional, unadjusted
  0.3 pct in march after an identical rise in february,
  department of trade and industry figures show.
the index for materials and fuel purchased by manufacturing
  industry fell a provisional and unadjusted 1.1 pct after a 1.7
  pct fall in february.
the department said the year-on-year rise in producer
  prices in march was a provisional 3.7 pct, compared with a
  provisional 4.2 pct increase in the year to end-february.
the index for output prices, non-seasonally adjusted, was
  put at a provisional 149.7 in march after 149.3 in february.
the index for input prices, also not seasonally adjusted,
  was set at 128.2 in march after february's 129.6.
the 1.1 pct fall in input prices between february and march
  was mainly due to a seasonal fall in industrial electricity
  costs and lower scheduled prices for petroleum products, the
  department said.
the department said these falls were only partly offset by
  a rise in prices of home-produced food manufacturing materials.
the seasonally adjusted index for input prices showed a 0.2
  pct rise between february and march.
year-on-year, the input price index was down 0.7 pct in
  march after a 2.8 pct drop in february.
statoil seeks share in thai gas field
  norway's state oil company
  den norske stats oljeselskap a/s (statoil) &lt;stat.ol>, has told
  thai authorities it is interested in taking a 30 pct share in a
  big offshore thailand gas field, statoil said.
the field, in the southern sector of the gulf of thailand,
  is currently operated by u.s. oil company texas pacific oil co
  inc, a unit of canada's seagram co ltd &lt;vo.n>.
thailand's state
  oil company &lt;petroleum authority thailand> (ptt) also holds a
  major stake in the field.
ptt wants to develop the field and has asked statoil to
  consider co-development if the field's licence is renewed.
ptt, according to statoil, is currently negotiating with
  texas pacific to buy back the dallas-based oil company's
  holdings in the field.
"ptt must first sort out its problems with texas pacific.
when this is done, we have said we are interested in taking
  over a 30 pct share in the field," statoil spokesman willy olsen
  told reuters.
statoil, hired by ptt to carry out an independent appraisal
  of the field's reserves and propose a development plan, has
  estimated the field could be commercially developed at a cost
  of some 700 mln crowns.
industry sources said texas pacific has submitted lower
  reserve estimates for the field than statoil and shown little
  interest in its development.
statoil refused to disclose its
  upgraded reserve estimate for the field.
the field's reserves could be sold domestically through
  thailand's gas distribution network or by converting the gas to
  electricity, the sources said.
sources would not say which field statoil is considering.
credit commercial de france splits shares
  french commercial bank credit commercial
  de france has split each of its shares into four to increase
  the number of shares on offer when it is privatised at the end
  of this month, a company official said.
he told reuters a general assembly had passed a proposal
  splitting 10.33 mln shares of 100 francs nominal into around
  41.32 mln shares of 25 francs nominal.
market sources have put the total value of ccf's selloff at
  between four and five billion francs.
the bank said the share
  sale price was likely to be announced on april 24, before the
  launch of a public flotation offer on april 27.
west german institutes call for early tax cuts
  the five leading west german economic
  research institutes said the government should do more to
  stimulate economic growth and called for early introduction of
  tax cuts planned for 1990.
in their joint spring report the institutes were divided
  about 1987 growth forecasts, with three predicting two pct
  expansion and the other two only one pct growth.
gross national
  product grew 2.4 pct last year.
but the report said all the institutes believed that "more
  must be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional
  jobs can be created."
the institutes said any step which improved basic economic
  conditions should be taken as quickly as possible.
"from this
  point of view, the tax reform planned for 1990 should be
  brought forward."
the government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billion
  marks as part of the major tax reform.
the net tax relief from
  the tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks.
however, the institutes criticised the government, not only
  for the timing of the reform, but also because the question of
  its financing had been left open.
the government has not specified how the remaining 19
  billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for,
  though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies.
the institutes said this lack of clarity from bonn had
  caused uncertainty among companies and households as to what
  exactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a
  quick decision from the government.
they also said the government should reduce tax
  preferences, which would simplify the fiscal system, urged a
  restriction of state spending and called for no increase in
  value-added tax.
the institutes also criticised bonn for increasing
  subsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged.
they referred specifically to a doubling of special
  writedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a
  package of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described this
  as an increase in subsidies.
the institutes said total subsidies, including tax
  preferences, had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risen
  further since then.
given the scope of these subsidies, it
  should be possible "despite ... major political difficulties" to
  finance the tax reform by cutting state handouts.
the institutes said that if the government raised value
  added tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the
  positive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost.
the report also noted that the government was progressing
  only slowly with its plans to privatise state companies and
  said more deregulation was needed.
the government had to aim
  for more competition, it said.

takeover battle for dome petroleum begins
  a takeover battle began today for
  debt-burdened dome petroleum ltd &lt;dmp.mo> as transcanada
  pipelines ltd &lt;trp.to> announced a 4.3 billion dlr offer and
  dome said it is continuing talks with other possible buyers.
companies mentioned in market speculation as potential
  buyers for dome include imperial oil ltd &lt;imo.a> which is 70
  pct owned by exxon corp &lt;xon.n>, &lt;pancanadian petroleum ltd>
  which is 87 pct owned by the conglomerate canadian pacific ltd
  &lt;cp.n> and british petroleum co plc &lt;bp.l>.
along with the transcanada offer, dome has had another
  proposal from "a substantial company" and discussions with a
  third company which could lead to an offer, dome said in a
  statement.
the statement confirmed dome received transcanada's bid,
  but did not identify the companies involved in talks.
transcanada, canada's largest natural gas pipeline
  operator, said it is offering dome a package of cash, common
  and preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary which
  would own and operate dome's assets.
transcanada said the offer
  is to dome management, not to shareholders.
dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in canada,
  totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed.
it also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs.
dome's statement said the transcanada announcement "violated
  the terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement entered
  into with prospective purchasers" and was apparently timed to
  prevent dome from considering other proposals.
it said the transcanada bid "seems to require favourable and
  substantial taxation concessions from the federal and
  provincial governments."
but dome added that its management and
  financial advisers will evaluate all proposals.
transcanada chief financial officer h. neil nichols said he
  was surprised at the vehemence of dome's statement and denied
  that transcanada was trying to usurp other bids.
"i find (dome's
  statement) very bothersome.
once the board made the decision to
  authorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announce
  it," he said.
nichols said he did not know the identity of the
  other bidders, or the terms of other offers.
dome common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on friday on the
  toronto stock exchange.
the preferred class a stock closed at
  5.00 dlrs.
common stock traded as high as 25.00 dlrs in 1981.
bank of japan to sell 800 billion yen in bills
  the bank of japan will sell 800 billion
  yen in deficit financing bills today through 51-day repurchase
  agreements maturing june 3 to help absorb a projected money
  market surplus, money traders said.
the operation will raise the outstanding supply of the
  bills to a record 4,800 billion yen.
the yield on the bills for sale to banks and securities
  houses from money houses will be 3.8999 pct compared with the
  two-month commercial bill discount rate today of 3.8750 pct and
  the two-month certificate of deposit rate of 4.13/00 pct.
the traders estimated the surplus today at about 1,800
  billion yen.
they said it is mainly due to 1,300 billion yen of
  government tax allocations to local governments and public
  entities and to excessive banking system cash holdings due to
  continuous large central bank dollar purchases.
lme clarifies new aluminium contract details
  the london metal exchange (lme) has
  issued a note clarifying details on its new high grade
  aluminium contract, in response to questions from members
  following the announcement of the contract, due to start june
  1.
all deliverable shapes of aluminium under the high grade
  primary aluminium contract (minimum 99.7 pct purity) will also
  be deliverable against the standard primary aluminium contract
  (min 99.5 pct), the lme said.
sows will not constitute good delivery against the standard
  contract until september 1, and 99.5 pct purity sows are not
  good delivery and cannot be placed on lme warrant.
the dollar quotation for the high grade contract will be in
  multiples of one u.s. dollar but carries may be made at 50
  cents for even tonnages only.
singapore, which is the first port warehouse outside europe
  to be used as an lme delivery point, will be used for high
  grade metal only and the rent imposed by owners steinweg will
  be 1.05 u.s. dlr a tonne per week, the lme said.
the lme board, in response to representation from the
  trade, agreed to annul from lme contracts the minimum weight
  requirements of 450 kilos for t-bars and 250 kilos for sows,
  effective for high grade on june 1 and for standard on july 24.
yield on 91-day sama deposits rises
  the yield on 91-day bankers security
  deposit accounts issued this week by the saudi arabian monetary
  agency (sama) rose to 6.43896 pct from 6.21563 a week ago,
  bankers said.
sama lowered the offer price on the 500 mln riyal issue to
  98.39844 from 98.45313 last monday.
like-dated interbank
  deposits were quoted today at 6-3/4, 5/8 pct.
sama offers a total of 1.9 billion riyals in 30, 91 and
  180-day accounts to banks in the kingdom each week.
north yemen bought white sugar at tender - trade
  north yemen at its weekend tender bought
  white sugar from a french operator acting on behalf of a swiss

the amount bought was not immediately available, although
  the country had sought 30,000 tonnes of june arrival whites,
  they said.
u.k. money market given 75 mln stg assistance
  the bank of england said it had provided
  the money market with 75 mln stg help in the morning session.
this compares with the bank's estimate that the system would
  face a shortage of around 400 mln stg today.
the central bank bought bank bills outright comprising two
  mln stg in band two at 9-13/16 pct, 15 mln stg in band three at
  9-3/4 pct and 58 mln stg in band three at 9-11/16 pct.
japan central bank actively buys dollars in tokyo
  the bank of japan actively bought dollars
  here in early afternoon trade at around 142.20 yen, dealers
  said.
the central bank had placed buy orders at that level and
  prevented the dollar from falling when it came under heavy
  selling pressure from investment trusts and trading houses,
  they said.
however, the intervention failed to boost the u.s. currency
  significantly from the 142.20 yen level, they added.
the dollar was trading around its midday rate of 142.30
  yen.
it had opened here at 141.85 yen.
currency moves may be hurting world trade
  japanese trade figures are seriously
  challenging the entrenched view of policy makers of the group
  of seven industrialised nations that relative currency rates
  are the key to smoothing world trade problems.
senior japanese, u.s. and european officials in tokyo say
  they are at a loss to fully explain the data, for if currencies
  are the key they ask, why then are are u.s. exports to japan
  shrinking?
what if manipulating currencies and driving the dollar down
  made world trade problems worse rather than solving them,
  fulfilling federal reserve chairman paul volcker's forecast of
  world trade recession?
u.s.-japan trade has declined even after a 40 pct dollar
  fall against the yen since the september 1985 group of five
  pact in new york.
the lower dollar ought to have made u.s. exports 40 pct
  more competitive in japan.
the officials, most of them
  economists, can offer no objective reason why they are not.
worse, how are european community sales to japan rising
  rapidly when the european currency unit has until now declined
  only 11 pct against the yen.?
last week's g-7 meeting in washington has been widely
  interpreted as a sign from the policy makers that the dollar
  must go lower.
so worst of all, what if volcker is correct?
at a loss to give an objective explanation, officials can
  only offer explanations which tend to be highly subjective.
"i don't know and i don't think anyone knows," said hugh
  richardson, acting head of the ec delegation in tokyo.
"what i do know is that community exporters are making a
  hell of an effort in this market.
if you make an effort, there
  is money to be made in japan," he added.
but u.s. officials and businessmen are convinced low u.s.
  exports to japan are japan's fault.
they cite restrictive trade
  practices, protected japanese trade sectors, such as
  agriculture, and non-tariff barriers, such as unreasonable
  checking and customs procedures for car imports.
publicly, japanese officials remain conciliatory in the
  face of what they see as u.s.
aggression.
in private, they
  blame u.s. industry for being uncompetitive.
"we see it that way, but we don't like to seem arrogant,"
  said a senior official, who declined to be named.
"we like to
  refrain from accusing them of not making enough effort."
industrialists such as eishiro saito, chairman of the
  keidanren business group, and sony corp chairman akio morita
  repeatedly accuse foreign firms of not making enough effort to
  understand japan's markets, and some foreigners agree.
"the real
  issue is the inability of major sectors of american and
  european industry to compete not only internationally but even
  in their home markets," peter huggler, president of interallianz
  bank zurich, told a recent conference in switzerland.

metal bulletin zinc producer price
  the london based trade journal "metal
  bulletin's" average producer price of good ordinary brand zinc
  for week ended april 10 is 790.00 dlrs per tonne.
u.k. producer prices seen moved by technicalities
  u.k. producer price data for march were
  roughly as expected after taking into account technical factors
  which affected the year-on-year outcome, economic analysts
  said.
the figures showed a 0.3 pct provisional, non-seasonally
  adjusted rise in output prices in march, unchanged from
  february and close to the average for the last six months.
the year-on-year rise was put at 3.7 pct, down from 4.2 pct
  in february.
but chris tinker, economist at brokerage house phillips and
  drew, said the drop in the year-on-year rate mainly reflected a
  rise in excise duties which affected the index in march last
  year.
he cautioned that it was dangerous to read too much into
  the monthly figure, adding that a rise of only 0.2 pct in april
  would take the year-on-year rise back above 4.2 pct.
analysts also noted that a drop in manufacturers' input
  prices was almost entirely due to anticipated seasonal factors
  such as a fall in industrial electricity costs.
duncan squire of lloyds merchant bank said the figures were
  slightly disappointing in that the strengthening of sterling
  had not yet reduced input prices as much as expected.
both he and tinker said this factor should help keep input
  costs down over the next few months, although tinker added that
  last year's fall in oil prices is now about to drop out of the
  year-on-year comparisons and is likely to lead to a return to
  rises in the index rather than falls.
bangemann rejects call for early tax cuts
  west german economics minister martin
  bangemann indirectly rejected a call from the country's leading
  economic research institutes for early introduction of a major
  tax reform involving gross tax cuts of 44 billion marks.
in a statement reacting to the five institutes' joint
  spring report, bangemann said that as far as the call for
  bringing forward the 1990 tax reform was concerned --
      "the government points out that the positive effects for
  growth of its policy of consolidation (cutting the budget
  deficit) must not be allowed to be endangered."
bangemann also recalled that the scope of tax cuts planned
  for 1988 had already been increased.
three institutes predicted two pct economic growth in 1987,
  with exports falling by 0.5 pct.
the other two saw only one pct
  growth and said exports would fall 2.5 pct.
bangemann said "the government, agreeing with the majority,
  sees no reason for the extraordinarily pessimistic estimate for
  exports expressed by the minority."
he said there was reason to believe that export demand
  would start to rise in the course of the year, partly because
  of a further increase in world trade.
italian gdp rose 2.4 pct in 1986 fourth quarter
  italy's gross domestic product, calculated
  at 1980 prices, rose 2.4 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986,
  compared with the same period in 1985, national statistics
  institute istat said.
istat said in a statement that gdp growth in fourth quarter
  1986 was zero compared with the preceding quarter.
italy's
  budget ministry said last month that 1986 gdp rose 2.7 pct in
  real terms from 1985.
imports in the fourth quarter totalled 26,361 billion lire,
  down 1.4 pct from the 1985 fourth quarter and down 6.6 pct from
  the third 1986 quarter, istat said.
istat said exports totaled 23,190 billion lire in the
  fourth quarter, down 4.1 pct from the comparable 1985 quarter
  and down 6.7 pct from the third quarter in 1986.
fixed investments were 23,438 billion lire in the fourth
  quarter, down 0.7 pct from the preceding quarter and up 1.1 pct
  from the comparable 1985 quarter.
g-7 seems worried markets ignore coordination
  top officials of leading industrial
  nations appear deeply worried that financial markets have
  ignored their efforts to coordinate policies, which they
  believe they strengthened in talks last week.
monetary sources said officials were exasperated that the
  markets, which drove the dollar rapidly lower and severely
  disrupted bond and stock markets too, did not take heed of the
  policy commitments of the group of seven -- the united states,
  japan, west germany, france, britain, italy and canada.
treasury secretary james baker went out of his way to
  reassure markets of his commitment to a stable dollar with a
  statement, and french finance minister edouard balladur
  underscored that by saying: "i don't believe at all that the
  americans want a weaker dollar."
west german finance minister gerhard stoltenberg said the
  dollar's latest rapid descent "involves the risk -- now already
  a tangible threat -- of a new strong surge of inflation,
  leading to a renewed rise in interest rates."
but there were signs too, that while policymakers feared
  the market uproar, they seemed to accept there was little they
  could do until the economic picture changed, and currencies
  settled into a stable pattern as a result.
nor did there seem to be any enthusiasm at last week's
  semi-annual meetings of the imf and the world bank for higher
  u.s. interest rates as the best way to curb the dollar's rapid
  descent.
that distaste stems in part from fears of recession.
outgoing deputy treasury secretary richard darman told
  television interviewers he did not think a policy of driving
  the dollar down would solve the u.s. trade deficit.
"it would slow growth in germany and japan which would
  adversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it would
  drive interest rates up here which would throw us, if not
  (into) recession, into slower growth," he said.
asked if higher u.s. interest rates would stabilize the
  dollar, balladur said: "when a currency is maintained
  artificially high, by artificially high interest rates, it is
  not healthy."
and resorting to higher interest rates could lead to
  recession, he said.
acknowledging the dollar's latest slide was now a fact of
  life, balladur said, "there may be adjustments of course in one
  or other currencies, this is not a fixed rate system."
but federal reserve board chairman paul volcker said he
  might rein in credit if the dollar's slide deepens.
u.s. monetary sources also said washington wanted it
  understood by markets the seven's commitments were genuine.
"the united states and the six major industrial countries
  are fully committed to implementing our undertakings in these
  agreements," baker told the meetings.
darman said baker had been misinterpreted by markets which
  wrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a further
  decline in the dollar.
baker, darman said, was committed to
  stabilizing currencies at current levels.
last week's statement from the seven reaffirmed a february
  22 agreement in paris in which the reagan administration agreed
  to reach a budget deficit compromise with congress and to fight
  protectionism.
west germany and japan, meanwhile, agreed to stimulate
  domestic demand and lead a global upturn.
ministers believed the paris pact was bolstered by japan's
  promise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget.
the sources said they believed baker saw it as a major
  action.
but the seven seem to accept their commitment to stable
  currencies applied to today's exchange rates and not those at
  the time of the paris agreement, when the dollar stood higher.
the paris accord said, "currencies (are) within ranges
  broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals, given
  the policy commitments summarized in this statement."
now they accept the dollar's lower level, especially
  against the yen, as hard reality that is nonetheless consistent
  with the agreement.
"the ministers and governors reaffirmed the
  view that around current levels their currencies are within
  ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals," last week's
  statement read.
monetary sources said policymakers understood markets were
  focusing on instability created by the gap between the u.s.
  trade deficit and the surpluses of west germany and japan
  rather than prospective policy changes.
european monetary
  sources said bonn was still unconvinced that washington meant
  business with its commitment to cut the budget deficit.
institutes see no west german recession
  the five leading west german economic
  research institutes, which have revised down their forecasts
  for 1987 growth, do not predict a recession in west germany,
  their spokesman, hans-juergen schmahl said.
the institutes were divided in their spring report on
  forecasts for 1987, with three predicting two pct growth and
  two seeing only one pct expansion.
growth was 2.4 pct in 1986.
schmahl, presenting the report at a news conference, said,
  "none of the institutes reckons with a recession or with the
  beginning of a recession."
he added, however, that exports
  remained the weak point of the economy .
schmahl also said west germany would have to expect further
  encroachments of foreign goods onto its markets.
arthur krumper of munich's ifo institute, which with the
  diw of west berlin had presented the more pessimistic view of
  the economy, said, "the braking effects (on the economy)
  produced by external factors will remain considerable for most
  of the year."

crazy eddie &lt;crzy> may make acquisition
  crazy eddie inc said it is
  negotiating for the possible acquisition of benel distributors
  ltd, which operates crazy eddie record and tape asylums in all

other details were not disclosed.
crazy eddie &lt;crzy> sets defensive rights
  crazy eddie inc said its board has

  21 will receive a right to purchase under certain circumstances
  at a price of 42 dlrs 0.01 preferred share for each common
  share held.
the rights will expire april nine.
the company said the rights would be exercisable 20
  business days after a party were to acquire 20 pct or more of
  crazy eddie common stock or announce a tender or exchange offer
  that would result in ownership of 30 pct or more.
crazy eddie said if a party owning 20 pct or more of its
  stock were to merge into it or if a party were to acquire 40
  pct or more of crazy eddie stock, right holders other than the
  acquiring party would be entitled to acquire common shares or
  other securities or assets with a market value equal to twice
  the rights' exercise price.
if after a party acquired 20 pct or more of its stock crazy
  eddie were acquired or 50 pct of its earnings power or assets
  sold, rightholders other than the acquirer would be entitled to
  buy shares of the acquirer's common stock worth twice the
  rights' exercise price, the company said.
crazy eddie said if a party were to acquire 30 pct or more
  of its common stock and then fail to acquire crazy eddie within
  180 days thereafter, rightholders would be entitled to exchange
  their crazy eddie common stock for subordinated notes of crazy
  eddie maturing either one year or, above a certain dollar limt,
  five years after issuance.
crazy eddie said adoption of the plan is not in response to
  any known effort to acquire control of it.
but the company
  said it has become aware of some "possible accumulations" of
  its stock has has received some "friendly inquiries."

zambia's kwacha falls at weekly auction
  the zambian kwacha fell at this week's
  foreign exchange auction to 18.75 kwacha to the dollar from
  last week's 16.95, the bank of zambia said.
the rate was the lowest since the auctions resumed two
  weeks ago under a new two-tier exchange rate system worked out
  with the world bank and international monetary fund.
the bank of zambia said it received 370 bids, ranging from
  13.00 to 20.75 kwacha, for the six mln dlrs on offer.
one
  hundred and thirty-five bids were successful.
a british high commission spokesman said britain would put
  eight mln stg into the auction at a rate of one mln a week as
  soon as zambia reached a full agreement with the imf.
the money could be spent only on goods produced and
  supplied by british firms, excluding luxuries and defence
  equipment, the spokesman added.
u.s. senate leader calls for interest rate cuts
  senate finance committee chairman
  lloyd bentsen (d-tex.)
called on major industrial countries to
  make a pledge at the coming economic summit in venice to cut
  interest rates.
"i think at the summit meeting in venice what we ought to be
  trying to do is to get the other major industrial nations that
  are involved to bring interest rates down, say, one pct,"
  bentsen told nbc television's "meet the press."
bentsen said coordinated rate cuts could take "billions off
  the debt service of the latin countries" and help ease
  protectionist pressures in the industrial countries.
bentsen also south korea and taiwan should be pressured to
  revalue their currencies in relation to the u.s. dollar.
"you take the taiwanese, with an enormous capital surplus,
  enormous trade surplus, and we've had very little cooperation
  there," he said.
departing deputy treasury secretary richard darman told the
  same television network he agreed that the u.s. dollar had not
  fallen enough against the currencies of some countries.
"i think that more does have to be done there in
  negotiations with the countries involved, the so-called nics
  (newly industrialized countries)," he said.
darman said such negotiations with newly industrialized
  countries were underway privately.
bentsen predicted congress and the white house would agree
  on a fiscal 1988 budget that would raise between 18 and 22
  billion dlrs in new revenues.
the texas senator said a series of excise taxes would be
  considered by congress, including an extension of the telephone
  tax and new levies on liquor and cigarettes.
bentsen said he supported an oil import fee, but that it
  would not happen without president reagan's support.
darman called for a "top level negotiation" between the white
  house and congress on a budget compromise that would include
  asset sales, some excise taxes, cuts in middle-class
  entitlement programs, "a reasonable, steady rate of growth in
  defense" and reform of the budget process.
offer for dome may short-circuit its debt talks
  a 3.22 billion dlr offer for dome
  petroleum ltd &lt;dmp.mo> by transcanada pipelines ltd &lt;trp.to>
  may short-circuit dome's restructuring plan and open the door
  for more takeover bids, oil analysts said.
dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt
  of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by july 1, 1987, when an interim
  debt plan that allowed the canadian oil and gas firm to defer
  substantial payments to creditors will expire.
analysts said transcanada's bid signals dome's debtholders
  that an alternative exists to dome's debt plan.
dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as
  public noteholders in march after several months of delicate
  negotiations.
transcanada's proposal "amounts to a quasi debt
  restructuring," oil analyst doug gowland of brown baldwin nisker
  ltd said from toronto.
calgary-based dome's restructuring plan would allow
  creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet
  to be negotiated.
payments on remaining debt would be linked to
  cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.
"the weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that
  even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that
  dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,"
  said wilf gobert, an oil analyst for peters and co ltd in
  calgary.
transcanada's announcement came as a surprise since dome
  was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed
  refinancing packages, gobert said.
the transcanada proposal could open the bidding for dome
  since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders
  to agree to a restructuring, he added.
"i would think that the debtholders would want to entertain
  any and all offers (for dome)," gobert said.
dome spokesman david annesley said in new york that
  transcanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix
  the bidding price for dome and an effort to preclude other
  possible buyers from making an offer.
"by drawing attention to
  us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little
  reluctant to come forward," he said.
dome does not consider transcanada's proposal a formal
  offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a
  confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.
dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions
  with transcanada in order to pursue talks with other
  unidentified parties.
however, dome said its management and
  financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including
  transcanada's.
gowland said transcanada's offer is probably a fair price
  for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.
however, he said not enough financial details are known
  about dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of
  transcanada's proposed offer.
sosnoff raises bid for caesars world &lt;caw>
  investor martin t. sosnoff said he has
  raised his offer for caesars world inc shares to 32 dlrs each
  from 28 dlrs and has reduced the number of shares he is seeking
  to 29.1 mln from all those not already owned.
in a newspaper advertisement, sosnoff said the bid by his
  mts acquisition corp, withdrawal rights and the proration
  period will now expire june 19 unless extended.
the offer had
  been scheduled to expire may 15.
in late march, sosnoff said he
  had received a "negligible" number of shares in response to the
  offer, which had been rejected by caesars as inadequate.
sosnoff already owns about four mln of caesars' 30 mln
  common shares now outstanding, or a 13.3 pct interest on a
  primary basis.
last week, caesars' board approved a recapitalization plan
  as an alternative to the sosnoff offer under which shareholders
  would receive a special dividend of 25 dlrs per share, subject
  to approval by shareholders at a special meeting to be held in
  june.
the company planned to borrow 200 mln dlrs and sell 800 mln
  dlrs in debt to finance the payout.
sosnoff said in the newspaper advertisement that the
  amended offer is conditioned on receipt of enough shares to
  give him a majority interest on a fully diluted basis and on
  the arrangement of financing, as well as to approvals by new
  jersey and nevada gaming authorities.
he said the tender would be the first step in acquiring all
  of caesars' shares and if successful would be followed by a
  merger transaction.
sosnoff said later in a statement that the 29.1 mln shares
  he is now seeking, together with the 4,217,675 shares he owns,
  would give him a 92.4 pct interest on a fully diluted basis.
he said he still has received only a "negligible" number of
  shares in response to his tender.
in a letter to caesars' chairman henry gluck included in
  the statement, sosnoff said gluck had again refused, on april
  8, to meet with him, even though he had said he was willing to
  increase the price of his offer.
sosnoff said the financing for the offer is almost fully in
  place.
sosnoff said painewebber group inc &lt;pwj> has now delivered
  to him commitments to purchase up to 475 mln dlrs of increasing
  dividend cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of mts holding
  corp, an indirect parent corporation of mts acquisition.
he said marine midland banks inc &lt;mm>, which leads a
  syndicate that has provided commitments for a 500 mln dlr
  margin facility, believes it will be able to arrange for
  further commitments under the margin facility to advance up to
  an additional 25 mln dlrs that may be needed to permit the
  purchase of shares under the offer.
sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender,
  each of the 2,750,000 caesars shares not covered by the offer,
  or 7.6 pct on a fully diluted basis, would be converted into
  series a preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby an
  independent investment baking firm.
he said "to the extent that fewer than 29,100,000 sdhares
  are purchased in the offer, the stockholders would receive a
  combination of cash and series a preferred stock having a value
  of 32 dlrs per share of caesars."
sosnoff said he believes terms of his offer are superior to
  caesars' recapitalization.
sosnoff said he will be meeting this week with gaming
  officials in nevada in an effort to expedite the investigatory
  process required for regulatory approval, a process that it
  already underway in new jersey.
he said his offer has been extended based on the likely
  duration of the regulatory process.
he said he intends to further extend the offer if the
  approval process is not completed by the expiration date.

pakistan confirms kenya tea import investigation
  pakistan's corporate law authority,
  cla, has begun an enquiry into imports of tea from kenya and
  the trade imbalance between the two countries, cla chairman
  irtiza husain confirmed.
he told reuters by telephone that importers liptons and
  brooke bond had been asked to supply data to the authority and
  a hearing would be held.
the cla would then report back to the commerce ministry,
  which had requested the enquiry.
husain said no date had yet
  been set for the hearing and declined to give further details
  of the matter.
industry sources told reuters reports that the companies'
  tea import licences had been suspended were incorrect.
portuguese economy remains buoyant despite crisis
  portugal's economy, which has been
  enjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade,
  may now be strong enough to shrug off the country's latest
  government crisis, analysts said.
but the april 3 ousting of prime minister anibal cavaco
  silva's government could slow economic reforms and investment
  as portugal continues to adapt to membership in the european
  community, which it joined in january last year, they said.
cavaco silva's minority social democratic party, psd, was
  toppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties.
the centre-right administration had made economic growth
  reform a priority in its 17 months in office.
in 1986, portugal's economy grew four pct, its current
  account surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs and
  inflation fell to 10 pct, from 20 pct in 1985.
analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instability
  were worrying but they felt the foundations for continued
  growth had not been badly shaken.
"the economy has developed a certain self-confidence that is
  now less dependent on the political situation," said fritz
  haser, economics professor at universidade livre, lisbon.
"the market doesn't see this as a real crisis yet," economist
  jorge braga de macedo told reuters.
businessmen have identified political instability over the
  last 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lasting
  economic progress.
the psd administration was the 16th formed since the 1974
  revolution.
portugal's developing stock markets, however, remain
  buoyant.
brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surge
  in economic confidence under the psd rule was still largely
  underpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts.
investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a bank of
  portugal forecast, released on the day the psd government fell,
  predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growth
  would remain at similar levels this year.
but analysts said the crisis interrupted current policies
  and could slow economic development.
soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the end
  of the month, can either call early elections or form a new
  government from parties in the existing left wing-dominated
  parliament.
many businessmen said they strongly favoured quick
  elections as the best solution.
"there is a good chance that a
  majority government could result from early elections,"
  confederation of portuguese industry (cip) president pedro
  ferraz da costa said.
he said they were optimistic this could mean the
  continuation in the near future of liberalisation policies
  introduced over the last year.
the left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, but
  the psd said it wants an early election in which opinion polls
  say they could win an overall majority.
a psd majority would also open the way for more
  wide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws and
  possible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said.
cavaco silva has accused the left-wing opposition parties
  of blocking key economic reforms.
the left-wingers said portugal's positive economic results
  were more the product of favourable international conditions
  such as cheaper oil and raw material imports, than of psd
  policies.

  about 79 mln dlrs a year through the pipeline's non-gas sales
  commodity rates.
this annual amortization amount is based on
  recovery of about 653 mln drls over an 8-1/4 year period,
  beginning april 1, 1987.
columbia gas said the filing would increase the pipeline
  commodity rates by 15.74 cts per mln btu to 2.95 dlrs per mln.
the company said it orginially sought to include these
  costs in its pga since the payments to products resulted in
  almost five billion dlrs in prospective price relief and were
  not related to take-or-pay buyout costs.
it explained this interpretation was based on ferc's april
  10, 1985, statement of policy which said that only take-or-pay
  buyout costs must be recovered through a general rate filing
  under the natural gas act.
as a result of renegotiating contracts for high-cost gas,
  columbia gas said, it has been able to reduce the average price
  paid for gas purchased from southwest producers to 1.96 dlrs
  per mln btu in december 1986 from 3.64 dlrs per mln in april
  1985.
the pipeline said southwestern producers account for 46 pct
  of its total available gas supply this year.
hungary raises prices in effort to curb deficit
  hungary has announced sharp price
  increases for a range of food and consumer products as part of
  its efforts to curb a soaring budget deficit.
the official mti news agency said the government decided
  consumer price subsidies had to be cut to reduce state
  spending.
from today the price of meat will rise by an average
  18 pct and that of beer and spirits by 10 pct, mti said.
the measures are also aimed at cooling an overheated
  economy, and could help dampen hungarians' appetite for
  imported western goods which consume increasingly expensive
  hard currency, the diplomats said.
the diplomats also said, however, that they did not expect
  the kind of social unrest that followed sharp price rises in
  other east bloc states, notably poland.
mti said consumer goods will also become more expensive,
  with the price of refrigerators rising some five pct.
it also
  announced a number of measures to ease hardship, including
  higher pensions and family allowances.

in last year's first quarter the company lost 60.0 mln dlrs
  or 55 cts per share on 108.4 mln shares outstanding, after a
  110.8 mln dlr writedown of oil reserves of its celeron corp
  unit.
goodyear said it will report first quarter results april 27.
goodyear chairman robert e. mercer also told the annual
  meeting that unless there is a major downturn in the economy,
  it expects to work its debt down to normal levels in three
  years through its restructuring and cash flow from improved
  margins.
the company set up its restructuring program to fend off a
  hostile takeover attempt by sir james goldsmith.
as part of
  the restructuring, goodyear executed a major stock buyback
  program that resulted in an increase in its debt.

trade issues straining ec's patience with japan
  member states of the european
  community are starting to run out of patience with japan which
  they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open
  its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.
diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by ec
  countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the
  willingness, or at least the ability, of the japanese
  government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the ec.
however, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as
  ec states know they would suffer almost as much as japan.
senior ec diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to
  an ec executive commission proposal under which the ec could
  raise tariffs on a range of japanese products if the u.s.
carries out a threat to make a similar move on april 17.
the ec tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations
  entered into with the world trade body gatt, would be designed
  to stop a diversion of exports to the ec market from that of
  the u.s.
the diplomats were meeting as tokyo announced that the ec's
  trade deficit with japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in
  march, up from 1.94 billion in february.
ec could decide on japan trade moves in late may
  the european community (ec) has
  effectively given japan six weeks to take moves to open its
  market to imports before it decides on possible tough
  retaliatory trade measures, ec diplomats said.
they said ec foreign ministers will meet on may 25 and 26
  to review the state of trade relations between the two sides.
the ec executive commission was asked by representatives of
  member states on friday to propose a renunciation of some ec
  pledges to the world trade body, gatt, unless there are
  "adequate and early measures to open the japanese market."
such a renunciation would be the first step to imposing
  stiff increases in duties, or quantitative limits, on japanese
  exports.
the diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would be
  discussed in detail at the next meeting of ec foreign ministers
  on april 27 and 28 in luxembourg as time was needed to prepare
  proposals for possible retaliatory action.
they said the commission has powers to take some limited
  action before getting ministerial approval to prevent japanese
  exports of electrical, photographic and other goods being
  diverted to europe following of possible u.s.
tariff moves.
in may, the ministers are also likely to discuss how to
  prevent japan from getting an extra trading advantage as a
  result of spain and portugal joining the bloc, which obliges
  them gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods.
japan's trade surplus with the community has grown
  steadily, registering a record 2.13 billion dlrs in march.

  international business machines
  corp said shipments and revenues were higher in the first

  expenses.
ibm said net income fell to 785 mln dlrs or 1.30 dlrs a
  share from 1.02 billion dlrs or 1.65 dlrs on about 1.8 pct
  fewer shares outstanding.
while total sales and income rose 5.5 pct to 10.68 billion
  dlrs from 10.13 billion dlrs, costs and expenses rose 12.1 pct
  to 9.61 billion dlrs from 8.57 billion in the quarter, the
  computer maker said.
the company said it continues to take actions to make it
  more competitive, including cost and expense reduction
  measures.
"although the worldwide economic situation remains
  unsettled, there are some encouraging signs in our business,"
  ibm said in a statement.
"in addition to the increase in first quarter shipments, we
  have announced new offerings in our large processor and
  personal computing product lines," it said.
"we have yet to fully benefit from our recent product
  announcements, retirement incentives and other resource
  balancing measures, and we expect these actions will have a
  more significant impact as 1987 progresses," the company added.
it said it expects more than 12,000 u.s. employees to take
  advantage of the retirement incentives announced last year.
pretax earnings fell 27 pct to 1.34 billion dlrs from 1.83
  billion, ibm said.
pretax margins slipped to 12.5 pct in 1987
  from 18.1 pct in 1986, it said.

german institutes warn on money supply
  four of west germany's five leading
  economic research institutes warned that excessive monetary
  growth threatened a resurgence of inflation.
but in a dissenting view the diw institute in west berlin,
  echoing recent statements by leading bundesbank officials, said
  the expansion seen over the last 1-1/2 years did not
  necessarily threaten stability.
the five institutes issued a joint spring report, in which
  three -- kiel, hamburg and essen -- forecast a two pct rise in
  gnp in 1987, while west berlin and munich predicted one pct.
the four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome in
  view of the slowdown in economic activity.
but experience has
  shown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price
  rise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy.
given virtual zero inflation in west germany such fears may
  seem exaggerated, they said.
"but it has often turned out in the past that the price
  climate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank into
  a restrictive policy," they said.
the economic costs of a preventive stability policy are
  less than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said.
the four institutes disputed the view that monetary
  expansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domestic
  investors switch liquidity into longer term capital market
  investments following lower interest rates.
"such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of
  central bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to a
  smaller expansion of money supply," they said.
a return to growth and stability did not require
  spectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly with
  open market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoid
  an interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations.
the diw institute said monetary policy should not be
  focused simply on growth of production potential.
because of
  uncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic
  weakness other factors should be taken into account.
monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts
  and avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation
  speculation.
recent strong monetary expansion was not a threat
  in itself to price stability.
the 1979/81 inflation following strong 1977/78 money growth
  reflected other causes, such as rising oil prices and the
  falling mark.

usda changes low protein wheat terminal prices
  the u.s. agriculture department has
  lowered its ascs terminal prices for low protein hard red
  winter and hard red spring wheat at a number of locations, a
  senior usda official said.
usda reduced the price of hard red winter wheat at kansas
  city and texas by six cents, at minneapolis and duluth by 32
  cents and at st louis by nine cents, ralph klopfenstein, deputy
  administrator of commodity operations at the agricultural
  stabilization and conservation service, said.
the department also lowered the terminal price of hard red
  spring wheat at minneapolis and duluth by 32 cents, he said.
in addition, usda cut the pacific northwest price of hard
  red spring wheat by 31 cents, usda officials who asked not to
  be identified said.
the officials said hard red spring wheat prices at chicago,
  denver and toledo were adjusted by about the same amount as at
  pacific northwest, duluth and minneapolis.
the price changes should lead to a pickup of pik and roll
  activity, klopfenstein said.
the price change was decided upon
  last week and will be effective today, he said.
klopfenstein also said the department raised the premiums
  on high protein wheat to offset the drop in low protein wheat
  prices, meaning the net price on any wheat commanding a protein
  premium would remain unchanged.

the meeting had been postponed from its original date of

  options, it said.
in addition, coopervision said operating income in its
  current fiscal quarter ending april 30 is expected to show an
  improvement over its prior fiscal quarter's 82.5 mln dlrs and
  its year ago quarter.
income from continuing operations was not immediately
  availalbe for the prior year's second quarter in which it
  reported a net loss of 14.9 mln dlrs.
at a drexel burnham lambert investor conference,
  coopervision chairman parker montgomery said, as previously
  announced, he will listen to any bid that makes sense for
  shareholders.
he also said coopervision's stock fell in 1986 due to its
  second quarter loss, rumors of a liquidation at 30 dlrs and 35
  dlrs a share, and ivan boesky's subsequent sale of his
  position.
"the stock dropped six dlrs in three days after boesky sold
  his position and has never recovered," montgomery said.
the
  company's stock is currently trading at 19-1/4.
montgomery further told the conference, "don't be an
  investor in the stock on the basis of any short term recovery
  in operating or net income in 1987 and 1988."
"our concentration is on maintaining or increasing market
  share in our core businesses this year and next, regardless of

allied stores &lt;als> sells dillard &lt;dds> two units
  dillard department stores inc, based
  in little rock, ark., and allied stores corp jointly said they
  entered a definitive purchase agreement for the sale to dillard
  of the joske's and the cain-sloan divisions of allied for 255
  mln dlrs cash, subject to certain closing adjustments.
the sale excludes certain real estate assets of joske's and
  cain-sloan, which allied estimates have an aggregate value of
  30 mln dlrs based on current market conditions.
joske's has 26 stores in texas and one in arizona.
cain-sloan has four stores in nashville.
joske's is the largest
  unit allied has slated for sale in its restructuring.
allied stores corp, a subsidiary of campeau corp, was
  acquired by acquired by the canadian developer last year.
robert campeau, chairman of allied, said "this is a
  terrific start to our disposition program which is proceeding
  well ahead of schedule.
this sale will fulfill the requirements
  under our bank agreements to sell certain assets by june 30 and
  give us additional flexibility in the disposal of the remaining
  divisions being sold."
allied stores is required to pay 200 mln dlrs in bank debt
  by june 30.
there had been some doubts on wall street that the
  company could meet the payment.
a campeau source said, "we believe this cash sale puts us
  in a very strong negotiating position to maximize the proceeds
  allied can receive from its other divisions."
"allied was able to put itself in a position where it knows
  it will be able to meet the june 30 payment schedules," the
  source said.
about 1.1 bilion dlrs in allied assets had been targeted
  for sale by dec. 31, 1988 to pay for the aquisition of allied
  by campeau.
allied will be taking bids for its other divisions.
targeted for sale are bonwit tellers, garfinckel's, dey's,
  donaldson's, herpolsheimer's, heer's, miller's, miller and
  rhoads, pomeroy's, catherine's, plymouth shops, and jerry
  leonard.
the divisions provided 38.4 pct of allied net sales
  and 11.8 pct of store profit in fiscal 1985.
ncr &lt;ncr> continues to expect earnings growth
  ncr corp, earlier reporting higher
  first quarter profit, said it continues to expect that it will
  report record earnings and revenue for all of 1987.
"our optimism is based on our incoming order rates and the
  strength of our product lines," the company said.
ncr corp plans additional new product announcements this
  year, it said without elaborating.
ncr earlier said first quarter profit increased to 61.5 mln
  dlrs or 65 cts share from 50.2 mln dlrs or 51 cts share in the
  prior year.
ncr's 1986 full-year earnings rose to 336.5 mln
  dlrs from 315.2 mln dlrs in the prior year.
ncr said the increase in first quarter profit resulted from
  strong revenue growth, which was particularly strong in europe
  and pacific marketing groups.
growth in u.s. revenues also improved, the company said.
first quarter revenues increased to 1.12 billion dlrs from
  960.8 mln dlrs in the prior year.
ncr's u.s. dollar value of 1987 first quarter worldwide
  incoming orders posted a very substantial gain over the prior
  year first quarter, ncr also said without giving specific
  figures.
order growth was broad based across ncr's product
  lines, with the greatest growth coming from u.s., it said.

foster &lt;fwc> unit audit reveals discrepancies
  foster wheeler corp &lt;fwc> said an
  audit of its stearns airport equiment co inc unit, revealed
  "substantial discrepancies" in stearns accounts that may
  require material adjustments to previously announce
  consolidated results of the company and its subsidiaries.
foster said certain stearn officers and senior management
  made stearn's operations appear more profitable than they were
  by improperly recording job costs.
it said stearn's president
  and controller had resigned.
a foster spokesman said he did not
  know the names of the president and controller, and could not
  immediately comment on the release.
foster said the amount involved in the "discrepancy" is
  about 13.7 mln dlrs before taxes or about 8.2 mln dlrs net
  after tax due to an "improper recording of job costs over a
  period of several years and continuing through part of the
  first quarter of 1987."
stearns is a unit of foster's conergic corp subsidiary.
the company said the impact on its results for 1987 was not
  "likely to be significant" but the amount to be charged to
  prior periods had not been determined.
foster reported after tax earnings of 28 mln dlrs, 26 mln
  dlrs and 35.4 mln dlrs for 1986, 1985, and 1984, respectively.
stearns, based in crowley, texas, makes airport baggage
  conveyor equipment and passenger loading bridges.
foster, a diversified international concern with 27
  subsidiaries operating worldwide, is based in livingston, new
  jersey.
its reported revenues for the period ended december 26,
  1986 of 1.3 billion dlrs.
the company said a detailed audit and investigation is
  continuing.
a company spokesman declined to comment further on
  the investigation.
taiwan announces new round of import tariff cuts
  taiwan announced plans for another round
  of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade
  talks with washington which officials described as a move to
  help balance trade with the united states.
wang der-hwa, deputy director of the finance ministry's
  customs administration department, told reporters the list of
  products included 60 items asked by washington.
"the move is part of our government efforts to encourage
  imports from our trading partners, particularly from the united
  states," he said.
he said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet
  that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles,
  apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut
  by between five and 50 pct.
the cabinet was expected to give its approval next thursday
  and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting
  on april 20, he added.
taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700
  foreign products last january aimed at helping reduce its
  growing trade surplus with the united states, the island's
  largest trading partner.
washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and
  pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade
  deficit with taipei.
washington's deficit with taipei rose to a record 13.6
  billion u.s. dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985.
it
  widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78
  billion a year earlier, taiwan's official figures show.
today's announcement came before a departure later today of
  a 15-member taiwan delegation for washington for a series of
  trade talks with u.s. officials.
the delegation's leader, vincent siew, told reporters last
  night he was leaving with "a heavy heart," meaning that he would
  face tough talks in washington because of rising protectionist
  sentiments in the u.s. congress.
taiwan's 1986 trade surplus
  with washington was the third largest, after japan and canada.
siew said the talks, starting on april 14, would cover u.s.
  calls for taiwan to open its market to american products,
  purchases of major u.s. machinery and power plant equipment,
  import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.
"i am afraid this time we have to give more than take from
  our talks with the u.s.," he said without elaborating.
bulgaria, romania grain crop seen less favorable
  current prospects for this year's
  grain crop in bulgaria and romania appear less favorable than
  in 1986, the u.s. agriculture department's officer in belgrade
  said in a field report.
the report said the assessment was based on travel in the
  two countries from march 30 to april 4.
it said crop conditions were better than earlier expected
  following the extreme dry conditions last fall and the
  prolonged winter temperatures this spring.
however, in general plant development was at least three
  weeks or more behind normal this spring, and conditions varied
  greatly by regions, the report said.
fields seeded during the optimum period last fall, and
  especially those receiving supplemental irrigation water (about
  65 pct of the fields observed), appeared to be in good
  condition, with little evidence of winterkill, while others
  varied considerably, the report said.
fields lacking adequate moisture last fall showed weak and
  uneven stands.
spotty germination and winterkill in those
  fields averaged 10 to 30 pct, it said.

  retaliation for kuwait's backing for iran's war enemy iraq.
diplomats said they expect three soviet tankers initially
  to reinforce other flags already supporting kuwait's 22-tanker
  fleet.
the diplomats said they knew of no deal for moscow to
  provide a naval escort for its own vessels, but "the idea of
  protection is implicit," one said.
they said soviet cargo ships bound for kuwait in the past
  to unload arms and materiel for road delivery to iraq were
  known to have sailed under escort.
so far, none of the soviet
  ships are known to have been attacked by iran.
diplomats said
  they expected the chartered soviet tankers to sail between
  kuwait and khor fakkan on the united arab emirates (uae) coast
  a short way outside the strait of hormuz at the mouth of the
  gulf.
chemical &lt;chl> net hurt by brazil, expenses
  chemical new york corp said its
  first-quarter profits fell by 16 pct, largely because it placed
  1.04 billion dlrs of loans to brazil on non-accrual.
chemical reported first-quarter net income of 86.2 mln
  dlrs, down from 102.6 mln a year earlier, but declaring the
  brazilian loans non-performing cost chemical 21 mln dlrs in
  lost interest income, or 12 mln dlrs after-tax.
a 13.3 pct jump in non-interest expense to 471.3 mln dlrs
  from 415.9 mln also hit the bottom line.
it said the rise was
  mainly due to staff costs associated with continued growth in
  consumer, capital markets and investment banking activities.
excluding the effect of placing brazil on non-accrual,
  chemical said its net income would have been 98.2 mln dlrs, or
  4.3 pct below 1986 earnings.
brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of
  medium- and long-term debt on february 20.
if they are not
  resumed by year's end, chemical said its after-tax net for the
  whole of 1987 will be reduced by about 51 mln dlrs.
chemical also placed 52 mln dlrs of loans to ecuador on
  non-accrual because the quito government also suspended
  interest payments on its foreign debt.
this reduced interest
  income by 1.5 mln dlrs.
chemical said net interest income fell to 476.4 mln dlrs
  from 488.9 mln and its net spread narrowed to 3.61 pct from
  3.96 pct.
this reflected the reclassification of brazilian loans, a
  reduced federal income tax rate (which affected the calculation
  of the taxabale-equivalent adjustment on tax-exempt assets) and
  a narrowing of the spread between the prime rate and chemical's
  cost of funds.
foreign exchange trading profits rose to 37.9 mln dlrs from
  27.0 mln, but bond trading profits dropped to 21.9 mln dlrs
  from 26.2 mln.
fees from trust and other banking services rose to 146.5
  mln dlrs from 129.3 mln a year earlier, chemical said.
the provision for loan losses was 87.2 mln dlrs, compared
  with 83.8 mln.
net loan charge-offs were 86.5 mln, up from 60.7
  mln, leaving the allowance for loan losses at 672.6 mln dlrs at
  quarter's end, or 1.74 pct of loans outstanding, compared with
  594.3 mln, or 1.50 pct, a year earlier.
non-accruing loans at the end of march were 2.39 billion
  dlrs (1.35 billion excluding brazil), compared with 1.35
  billion at the end of 1986 and 1.22 billion at the end of
  march, 1986.
genetics &lt;geni.o> sees higher 87 losses
  genetics institute inc,
  earlier reporting an increased first quarter net loss, said it
  expects to incur losses in fiscal 1987 "that are somewhat higher
  than those reported in fiscal 1986."
it had a loss of 4,504,000 dlrs for fiscal 1986 ended
  november 30, compared to a fiscal 1985 loss of 1,732,00 dlrs.
the company said the losses result from its strategic
  decision to invest prudent levels of equity in development of
  products the company can manufacture and bring to market.
genetics earlier said first quarter ended february 28
  losses rose to 1,309,000 dlrs from year-ago loss of 937,000
  dlrs.
investor boosts trans-lux &lt;tlx> stake

fed adds reserves via customer repurchases
  the federal reserve entered the u.s.

dealers said federal funds were trading at 6-1/2 pct when
  the fed began its temporary and indirect supply of reserves to

most had expected the fed to supply reserves directly via

some believe the fed is adding fewer reserves than are needed

national westminster bank usa 1st-qtr net rises
  national westminster bank usa said
  higher loans and core deposit volumes as well as a substantial
  increase in net interest income contributed to a 16 pct rise in
  first-quarter earnings to 17.7 mln dlrs from 15.3 mln reported
  a year earlier.
the earnings gain came despite a 1.5 mln dlr reduction of
  income as a result of placing brazilian loans on non-accrual.
net interest income totalled 92.5 mln dlrs compared with
  91.7 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period as loans, mostly to
  middle market businesses, increased by 896 mln dlrs.
but some
  of these gains were offset by low levels of interest rates.
provision for loan losses rose to 13.8 mln dlrs from 13.0
  mln a year earlier.
at march 31, the allowance for loan losses
  was 114.2 mln dlrs versus 94.8 mln at end of march 1986.
non-accrual loans rose to 286 mln dlrs from 132 mln at the
  end of the first quarter of 1986, largely because 119 mln dlrs
  of loans to brazil were put on non-accrual status.
the bank said that if these loans remain on non-accrual for
  the remainder of the year net income for 1987 would be reduced
  by about 4.9 mln dlrs.

  of national westminster bank plc.

talking point/ibm &lt;ibm>
  international business machines corp
  has started the year aggressively, but industry analysts said
  the company still faces some tough rounds in its fight to stop
  a two-year earnings slump.
"i am more impressed with what's happening at ibm than i
  have been in a long time," said painewebber analyst stephen
  smith.
"but they're not out of the woods yet," he added.
at 1.30 dlrs a share, ibm's first-quarter net income easily
  topped most estimates on wall street, which had ranged from an
  even dollar to 1.20 dlrs.
most analysts said they were pleasantly surprised by ibm's
  performance.
but they indicated that ibm's chances for a full
  recovery hinged on several key factors whose impact will not be
  felt until later in the year.
these include the success of ibm's new personal computer
  line, introduced two weeks ago, and its 9370 minicomputers,
  which will begin volume shipments in july.
in addition, ibm has said the full benefits of its
  early-retirement program and other cost-cutting moves will
  emerge as the year progresses.
analysts noted that ibm chairman john f. akers was
  relatively more upbeat in assessing the company's outlook than
  he has been for nearly a year.
"although the worldwide economic situation remains
  unsettled, there are some encouraging signs in our business,"
  akers said, pointing to, among other things, higher
  first-quarter shipments.
"we remain optimistic about the
  prospects for both the industry and ibm," he said.
"akers was most encouraging," said painewebber's smith.
a weak dollar, a lower tax rate and strong mainframe
  computer sales all contributed to the better-than-expected
  first-quarter results, analysts said.
"shipments of the 3090 mainframes were very strong in
  march," after a weak january and february, said ulric weil of
  washington-based weil and associates.
sales of the top-of-the-line mainframes, commonly called
  the sierras, "bailed out the whole quarter," weil said, adding,
  "if this continues, it augers well for the rest of the year."

  brazil and ecuador on non-accrual status.
income in the first three months fell to 28.60 mln dlrs
  from 30.43 mln in the same 1986 period.
earnings per share
  dropped to 1.51 dlrs from 1.62.
irving put 215 mln dlrs of brazilian and 33 mln dlrs of
  ecuadorean loans on non-accrual, reducing first-quarter net
  income by a total of 4.4 mln dlrs after tax.
irving estimates full year net would be reduced by 15.3 mln
  dlrs after tax if no cash interest payments are received on
  these loans during the remainder of 1987.
also adversely affecting earnings were losses on the
  trading of securities and higher non-interest expenses,
  although these were partly offset by increased trust income,
  profits from foreign exchange trading and investment securities
  gains, the bank said.
the allowance for loan losses was 224.8 mln dlrs, up from
  185.2 mln a year earlier.
the provision for loan losses was
  21.8 mln versus 19.5 mln in the first quarter of 1986.

  perelman, offered 18.50 dlrs a share for the 63 pct of revlon
  shares he did not already own.

canada stocks/dome petroleum ltd &lt;dmp>
  dome petroleum ltd shares moved higher

  made a 4.3 billion canadian dlr bid for dome and dome said it
  is in talks with two other unidentified companies.
market speculation is that the other two potential bidders
  are not canadian companies and dupont's &lt;dd> conoco and
  atlantic richfield co &lt;arc> are mentioned as possibilities,
  wilf gobert of peters and co ltd said.
dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the american stock exchange.
transcanada pipelines was down 1/4 at 15-3/4 on the new york
  stock exchange.
dome was the most active stock on the toronto exchange at
  1.50 dlrs per share, up 37 cts.
gobert characterized the market action in dome as "awfully
  optimistic" but said investors are hoping for a competing offer
  to the shareholders.
transcanada pipelines' offer is to dome management, not to
  shareholders.
however, it proposes issuing new equity in a
  subsidiary that would operate dome assets.

gte &lt;gte> cites loss of sprint
  gte corp said the decline in its
  first quarter net income reflects a 121 mln dlr loss from its
  50 pct share ownership of u.s. sprint's operations.
this loss is an increase from the 60 mln dlrs loss reported
  on operations gte owned a year ago quarter and prior to
  entering a joint venture with united telecommunications &lt;ut> in
  july 1986.
under the joint venture, each company owns 50 pct of
  sprint.
earlier, the company reported net income declined to 265.0
  mln dlrs from 283.0 mln dlrs in the first quarter a year ago.
theodore brophy, chairman of gte said, "we expect us
  sprint's losses to diminish later this year as customer traffic
  migrates to the new fiber-optic network for long distance
  telecommunications.
the reason for the higher losses reflect lower prices as
  well as higher operating costs related, in part, to the
  fraudalent use of the network.
operating income of its telephone operations, which account
  for 91 pct of the total, rose eight pct to 736.0 mln dlrs.
revenues from telephone operations rose eight pct to 2.9
  billion dlrs.
goodyear &lt;gt> to sell celeron
  goodyear tire and rubber co said it

after the company's annual meeting, rober mercer,
  goodyear's chairman and chief executive officer, also said 
  goodyear expects to report a profit of more than one dlr a
  share from continuing operations in the first quarter.
in the
  same year-ago period, goodyear reported a loss of 64 cents a
  share from continuing operations.
mercer said about seven companies are interested in buying
  celeron and they may form a consortium to buy the unit.
celeron consists of oil and gas reserves and an almost
  complete pipeline linking drilling operations in santa barbara,
  calif., to texas refineries.
mercer said celeron's reserves
  would not be sold separately from the pipeline.
concerning speculation that two billion dlr price tag for
  celeron was too high, mercer said "there is no fire sale going
  on here and we can continue to keep celeron as a profitable
  operation throughout the year."
mercer said the expected 1st quarter operating profit was
  based on the new share total after goodyear's share repurchase
  last year to fend off sir james goldsmith's hostile takeover
  bid.

aristech &lt;ars> says 1st qtr shr estimate right
  aristech chemical corp chairman and

  estimates of its 1987 fiscal year earnings of 2.25 dlrs to 2.50
  dlrs per share are about right.
addressing a gathering of analysts and institutional
  investors, marshall also said that analysts' estimates of its
  first qtr earnings - 50 cts to 55 cts per share - were "in the
  ballpark."
marshall said the full year estimates represent more than a
  32 pct increase over 1986's fiscal year net of 1.70 dlrs per
  share.
he also said the first quarter estimates were 70 pct higher
  than 1986's first quarter net of 29 cts per share.
marshall attributibuted the first quarter earnings growth to
  several factors, including sustained demand in aristech's major
  domestic markets and continued growth in exports.
aristech plans to spend approximately 200 mln dlrs over in
  capital investments over the next three years, marshall added.
united telecom &lt;ut> reports us sprint loss
  united telecommunications inc
  said its lower first quarter earnings included a loss of

  combined united telecommunications' long distance voice and
  data operations with those of gte corp &lt;gte>.
earlier, united telecommunications reported first-quarter
  earnings of 12.6 mln dlrs, or 13 cts a share compared to 46.4

revenues declined to
  720.2 mln dlrs from 793.6 mln dlrs.
united telecommunications said the transition of us
  sprint's nationwide fiberoptic network is proceeding ahead of

it said the transition to the fiber network from interim
  networks would not only reduce operating costs in the second
  half of 1987, but also assist in controlling unauthorized

gaf &lt;gaf> seen raising borg-warner &lt;bor> bid
  gaf corp, set on acquiring borg-warner
  corp's valuable plastics business, is believed by analysts to
  be preparing an increased offer for the chicago-based company.
yesterday, borg-warner said it agreed to be acquired for
  4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by merrill lynch
  capital partners.
merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for
  89 pct of borg-warner's common stock, and a package of cash and
  securities for the balance.
borg-warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8.
"i think it's (the stock price) telling us gaf is coming in
  with another bid," said one analyst, who values the company at
  51 or 52 dlrs per share.
gaf has offered 46 dlrs per share.
it holds 19.9 pct of
  borg-warner's stock.
"you're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to up
  the price.
obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you have
  to.
i think gaf is looking at the company the way we're looking
  at it - that it's worth more," pershing and co analyst richard
  henderson said.
henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share.
gaf has only said it was reviewing the situation.
merrill
  lynch officials did not return phone calls.
analysts have said they believe gaf chairman samuel heyman
  sought borg-warner because of its chemicals and plastics
  business.
the rigid plastics are used in such things as
  telephones, computer terminals, and appliances.
"where the heck can you buy a world class chemical
  operation these days," said henderson.
"he's (heyman's) got the bucks.
he's a heavy hitter, and he
  does not like to get pushed around," said henderson.
gaf, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeover
  of the much larger union carbide corp two years ago.
while gaf
  did not win the company, it made a substantial gain on its
  investment in carbide.
analysts said gaf already has a large profit built into its
  borg-warner holdings.
they said even if gaf raises its offer
  and does not succeed, a higher bid from another company would
  give gaf millions of dollars in profits on its stock.
"it's a win-win situation," said one analyst.
one analyst speculated an offer from gaf would be
  forthcoming shortly.
"i think we are finally down to the final paragraph in this
  book," he said.
borg-warner's other businesses include automotive parts,
  protective services, which includes wells fargo security
  guards, and chilton corp, a credit rating service.
charles rose, an oppenheimer and co analyst who follows
  gaf, said if gaf were to sell into the merrill lynch offer, it
  would realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 per
  share.
"i think there's a probability he goes up in price," said
  rose.
rose said, however, he could not really predict what heyman
  would do.
"sam's a low-risk, high-return player."
"is he trying to build a major industrial chemical
  enterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank," rose
  said.
analysts said borg-warner's chemical business would add
  earnings momentum to gaf.
"i worked out that paying as much as
  50 dlrs per share would still be additive to gaf in time, if
  they sold off most of the non-chemical facilities," said john
  henry of e.f. hutton.
borg-warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986
  operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billion
  dlrs.
total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and net
  earnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986.

ec meat directive deadline seen flexible
  u.s. officials said they held out
  little hope the european community, ec, would withdraw a
  controversial meat inspection requirement, due to go into
  effect april 30 and which u.s. meat producers claim will cut
  off their exports.
but the officials said they expect the ec to allow u.s.
  plants to continue shipping meat through the end of the year
  provided they submit a plant improvement program with the u.s.
  agriculture department.
the ec's so-called third country meat directive will
  require foreign meat processing plants to comply fully with ec
  inspection standards beginning april 30.
the u.s. meat industry has prepared a petition requesting
  the reagan administration to retaliate against the ec rule.
at issue are u.s. meat exports to the ec valued at 132 mln
  dlrs in 1985.
the ec rule would require all u.s. plants to make changes
  in their inspection methods, ranging from veterinary staffing
  to use of wood.
last december, the ec determined that only one u.s. cattle,
  one hog and one sheep slaughtering facility could be approved
  without further review.
usda would have to certify that the
  plants had corrected the deficiencies.
all remaining plants with a history or potential of
  shipping to the ec -- totaling nearly 400 -- would require more
  significant changes in plant constructions or procedures before
  further ec review.
robert hibbert, general counsel for the american meat
  institute, said the meat industry expected to submit a formal
  trade retaliation petition by april 30.
an interagency committee is reviewing the industry's draft
  petition.
an official at the u.s. trade representative's office said
  u.s. officials continued to press the ec to withdraw the rule,
  but that "the chances of that are not too good at this time."
however, there is the "expectation" in u.s. government and
  meat industry circles that the ec will continue to allow
  shipments, at least through the end of the calendar year, from
  u.s. plants that submit to usda a plan on how they will bring
  their operations into conformity with the ec regulation, the
  ustr official said.
u.s. banks likely to lift prime rates again soon
  major u.s. banks may lift prime
  lending rates again within days due to recent increases in
  their borrowing costs and speculation the federal reserve is
  nudging up interest rates to help the dollar, economists said.
in what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, most
  banks in early april lifted their rates a quarter point to
  7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own
  cost of money.
that spread has narrowed again.
"a prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,"
  said robert brusca of nikko securities co international inc.
      brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is
  justified because the spread between banks' cost of funds and
  the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a
  percentage point.
he said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentage
  points since last october until it fell below one point and
  triggered the april prime rate rise at most banks.
"we could easily have another prime rate increase as soon
  as this week," said david jones of aubrey g. lanston and co.
      "we've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the
  near future," said allan leslie of discount corp.
      "based on the spread between the prime rate and funding
  costs, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,"
  said harold nathan, economist at wells fargo bank.
however, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime
  because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan
  demand and because some are not sure the fed will maintain
  recent upward pressure on money market interest rates.
nathan believes the fed has let market pressures lift
  short-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar.
he
  said "if there is widespread belief money market rates will
  stay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time."
fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a
  dollar drop could help rekindle u.s. inflation.
as the dollar
  fell to a 40-year low against the yen friday, currency traders
  said the fed and other central banks supported the dollar.
in addition to buying dollars outright, another way to
  stabilize the u.s. currency would be for the fed to push u.s.
  interest rates higher relative to overseas rates.
based particularly on the fed's reserve management actions
  on friday and today, nathan of wells fargo said "it has become
  clear that the fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure
  in the market.
it is supplying fewer reserves than are needed."
bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest
  rates rose sharply friday and today on heightened speculation
  that the fed is gently firming monetary policy.
that was because the fed supplied far fewer reserves in the
  market than most economists had expected.
on friday, the fed added reserves indirectly and in small
  amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements
  with the federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another
  high at 6-5/16 pct.
with funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct
  today, the fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr
  round of customer repurchase agreements.
"the fed's actions on friday and today show that it is
  offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,"
  said jones of lanston.
"the fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the
  need to defend the dollar," jones said.
he believes it is
  merely shading policy toward restraint now, "but to have a
  major impact on the dollar, the fed will have to tighten policy
  overtly at some point."
jones expects the fed to foster higher market rates by
  becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, within
  four to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct.
jones said a u.s. discount rate increase to six pct might
  well be accompanied by west german and japanese rate cuts to
  further aid the dollar.
given likely fed policy firming, he said both the yield on
  30-year treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime rate
  may be at 8-1/2 pct at end-june and nine pct by year's end.
"the jury is still out on whether the fed is tightening
  policy to defend the dollar," said leslie of discount corp.
he
  said tax-date pressures have been pushing up fed funds lately.
leslie said fed actions and reserve data once these pressures
  abate will show whether or not it is firming policy.

  commitments in hand will ship during the period.
it said its outlook for the year remains unchanged.
nova &lt;nva.a.to> not planning dome &lt;dmp> bid

"we've no plan to bid," blair told reporters after a speech
  to a business group, although he stressed that nova and 57
  pct-owned husky oil ltd &lt;hyo> were interested in dome's
  extensive western canadian energy holdings.
"but being interested can sometimes be different from
  making a bid," blair said.
transcanada pipelines ltd &lt;trp> yesterday bid 4.30 billion
  dlrs for dome, but dome said it was discontinuing talks with
  transcanada and was considering a proposal from another company
  and was also talking with another possible buyer, both rumored
  to be offshore.
asked by reporters if dome should remain in canadian hands,
  blair replied, "yes.
i think that we still need to be building
  as much canadian position in this industry as we can and i
  think it would be best if dome ends up in the hands of canadian
  management."
he said he did not know who other possible bidders were.
blair said that any move to put dome's financial house in
  order "will remove one of the general problems of attitude that
  have hung over western canadian industry."
he added, however, that the energy industry still faced "a
  couple of tough, tough additional years."
asked about nova's 1987 prospects, blair predicted that
  nova's net profit would rise this year to more than 150 mln
  dlrs from last year's net profit of 100.2 mln dlrs due to
  improved product prices and continued cost-cutting.

wall street stocks/browning ferris &lt;bfi>
  the environmental protection agency's
  five to 10 mln dlr suit against a browning-ferris industries

  drop today, analysts said.
the stock has fallen 2-1/4 to 56-1/8 so far today, after
  the news about the suit was released this morning.
"it's potentially a big suit and investors feel that its
  not good to go against regulators," kenneth ch'u-k'ai leung, a
  smith barney analyst said.
"what investors are actually saying by selling off some bfi
  shares is the cloud over this industry is the threat that the
  epa will get tough on waste management companies," willard
  brown, senior analyst for first albany corp.
      "investors are saying to themselves that waste management
  companies have that kind of exposure to regulatory suits,"
  brown said.
brown said if the suit were settled for 10 mln dlrs
  it would have an impact on browning ferris earnings.
leung said, however, that browning-ferris has adequate cash
  reserves to cover the fine.
"it would have no impact on
  earnings whatsoever," he said.
homestake &lt;hm> mulls buying ore reserves
  homestake mining co is considering
  acquiring more gold ore reserves in addition to the company's
  exploration efforts, chief executive harry conger told reuters
  in an interview.
"we are looking at more options to acquire more reserves
  rather than just exploration," conger said adding, "the move to
  consider acquisitions represents a change in the company's
  acquisitions policy."
conger said all of homestake's current cash position of 120
  mln dlrs would be available to acquire reserves.
in addition,
  homestake has two lines of credit totaling 150 mln dlrs which
  have not been drawn on today and could be used to finance an
  acquisition, he said.
conger said he anticipates 1987 exploration budget will be
  about the same as 1986 spending of 27.3 mln dlrs.
conger said
  exploration for precious metals may be slightly higher than
  last year's spending of 17.7 mln dlrs while oil and gas
  exploration spending will be slightly less than last year's 9.6
  pct.
conger said he sees homestake's 1987 gold production about
  the same as 1986 gold production of 669,594 ounces.
however, 1987 first quarter production from its mclaughlin
  reserve will be about 10 pct lower than last year's 45,400
  ounces due to start-up production problems.
he said he believes gold prices will hold above the 400
  u.s. dlr an ounce level for the rest of 1987.
in 1986, company earnings were based an average market
  price for gold of 368 dlrs an ounce.
conger said a three pct change in gold prices represents a
  12 cts a share impact on earnings but he declined to give a
  specific forecast for 1987's first quarter, due to be released
  in 10 days, or for full year 1987 results.

  rose to 43.7 mln dlrs or 96 cts a share from 36.4 mln dlrs or
  79 cts in the same period a year ago.
better operating results in each of the company's three 
  sectors offset higher interest costs in the first quarter due
  to financing the december acquisition of sperry aerospace and
  the sharing of the federal systems subsidiary pre-tax profit
  with honeywell bull inc, honeywell said.
"our first quarter results show clear benefits of our
  restructuring," chairman edson spencer said.
"all of our
  businesses are producing better results than last year, even
  though we do not see significant improvement in the external
  market environment," he said.
total orders in the first quarter were up substantially,
  with a sharp increase in aerospace and defense orders in
  addition to those of the new sperry aerospace group, it said.
domestic industrial automation and control orders were
  modestly higher than the same period in 1986, it said.
orders in honeywell's home and building automation and
  control business were flat in the u.s. and up in international
  markets, it said.
international orders increased, with the greatest strength
  in europe, honeywell said.
the company said that by year-end 1987, it intends to
  complete the repurchase of 3.3 mln shares remaining of a five
  mln share buyback program which began in 1986.

homestake mulls buying ore reserves
  homestake mining co is considering
  acquiring more gold ore reserves in addition to the company's
  exploration efforts, chief executive harry conger told reuters
  in an interview.
conger said, "the move to consider acquisitions represents
  a change in the company's acquistions policy."
conger said all of homestake's current cash position of 120
  mln dlrs would be available to acquire reserves.
in addition,
  homestake has two lines of credit totaling 150 mln dlrs which
  have not been drawn on and could be used to finance an
  acquisition, he said.
conger said he anticipates 1987 exploration budget will be
  about the same as 1986 spending of 27.3 mln dlrs.
conger said exploration for precious metals may be slightly
  higher than last year's spending of 17.7 mln dlrs while oil and
  gas exploration spending will be slightly less than last year's
  9.6 pct.
conger said he sees homestake's 1987 gold production about
  the same as 1986 gold production of 669,594 ounces.
however, 1987 first quarter production from its mclaughlin
  reserve will be about 10 pct lower than last year's 45,400
  ounces due to start-up production problems.
he said he believes gold prices will hold above the 400
  u.s. dlr an ounce level for the rest of 1987.

kuwaiti daily says opec credibility at stake
  opec's credibility faces fresh scrutiny
  in coming weeks amid signs of a significant rise in supplies of
  oil to international oil markets, the kuwait daily al-qabas
  said.
in an article headlined, "gulf oil sources say middle east
  production up 1.4 mln bpd," it warned opec's official prices
  could face fresh pressure from international oil companies
  seeking cheaper supplies.
it did not say whether only opec or both opec and other
  producers were behind the reported rise in mideast output.
nor
  did it specify if the sources were official or other contacts.
"the sources said the credibility of opec would come under
  fresh scrutiny from today (monday), with activity in the
  european and american markets," the daily said.
the sources were quoted as saying that after opec had in
  march demonstrated its commitment to quota agreements, some
  members had raised output last week.
it gave no details.
"dealers in oil markets were now waiting to see if opec was
  able to control production, or whether the days of cheating and
  producing over quotas has begun anew," it said.
the sources warned that "maybe the (price of a) barrel of
  oil will fall below 18, perhaps 17.80 dlrs this week or next if
  there is no control on supplies," it said.
"the sources believed a return of oil below 18 dlrs a barrel
  may open the doors for international oil companies to pressure
  opec over contract prices, similar to the struggle last march,"
  it said, apparently referring to resistance by buyers to lift
  from qatar unless it gave price discounts.
"more than one official has warned opec would find its
  solidarity under scrutiny by the end of april or start of may,"
  it said, noting demand usually fell with the onset of summer.

american century &lt;act> restates earnings
  american century corp said it
  has restated its earnings for the fiscal year ended june 30,
  1986 to provide an additional five mln dlrs to its loan loss
  allowance, causing a restated year-end net loss of 14,937,000
  dlrs, instead of 9,937,000 dlrs.
the company said the change came after talks with the
  securities and exchange commission on the company's judgement
  in considering the five mln dlrs collectible.
in the note to its 1986 financial statement, american
  century said it considered the five mln dlrs collectible,
  making its loan loss provision less than required.
the company said in spite of the sec decision, it still
  feels its allowance for possible loan losses at june 30, 1986
  was adequate and that it has considered all relevant
  information to determine the collectibility of the five mln dlr
  receivable.
but, it said continued disagreement with the sec staff
  would not be in its best interest.

u.s. agency rules against brazil orange juice
  the u.s. international trade
  commission, itc, voted to authorize the commerce department to
  impose anti-dumping duties on imports of brazilian frozen
  concentrated orange juice.
the itc voted 3-2 in favor of the anti-dumping petition in
  its final ruling on the matter.
today's itc ruling was consistent with the commerce
  department's final ruling of march 9, and activates an
  anti-dumping duty of 1.96 pct on imports of brazilian frozen
  concentrated orange juice, stephen vastagh, itc investigator
  said.
the itc found that brazilian orange juice imports have
  injured u.s. producers.
the commerce department had already
  ruled that the imports were unfairly priced, and lowered to
  1.96 pct the anti-dumping margin that in a preliminary decision
  last fall had been set at 8.5 pct, vastagh said.
the u.s. government has been requiring bond to be posted on
  imports of brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice since
  commerce's preliminary ruling of last october 23, he said.
commerce had ruled that one major brazilian producer --
  cutrale -- would be excluded from the anti-dumping duty.
brazilian imports account for about 40 pct of total u.s.
  supply, vastagh said.
between december 1985 and november 1986,
  the united states imported the equivalent of 546 mln gallons of
  brazilian orange juice worth 622 mln dlrs, he said.
currently, the united states requires a 35-cent per gallon
  tariff on orange juice imports, vastagh said.
an itc spokesman said the agency would forward its final
  report on the anti-dumping case to commerce by april 22.
commerce then will process the anti-dumping order and
  transmit it to u.s customs, which will liquidate bond entries
  dating from commerce's preliminary ruling and begin assessing
  duties, vastagh said.
he said about 12 brazilian orange juice exporters,
  including three major shippers, would be affected by the
  decision.

texaco &lt;tx> says some oil flows re-established
  texaco inc has re-established some key
  oil supply lines following yesterday's court filing for
  protection under chapter 11 of the u.s. bankrupcty code, said
  elton yates, texaco's coordinator of worldwide operations.
"several companies say they are willing to start trading,"
  yates told reuters in an interview.
the company last week had stated that a number of domestic
  and international oil suppliers were demanding cash for oil
  shipments, and in some cases, had cut supplies altogether.
banks had also cut credit lines, it said in court filings.
manufacturers hanover corp &lt;mhc> and other banks told
  texaco it would cut off a one billion dlr credit line, texaco
  said in the court filing.
chase manhattan corp &lt;cmb> and j.p.
  morgan co's &lt;jpm> morgan guaranty trust co asked for deposits
  to cover transactions, it said.
the severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arose
  from an unfavorable ruling last monday by the u.s. supreme
  court in texaco's ongoing dispute with pennzoil co &lt;pzl> over
  the acquisition of getty oil co in 1984.
the high court said texas courts must consider texaco's
  plea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case.
"most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as they
  could," elton said.
but following monday's supreme court
  ruling, texaco's suppliers began demanding cash and halting
  supplies.
"it wasn't until last wednesday that it turned into an
  avalanche," he said.
"supplies were cut to the point where we
  could not run the system at anywhere near capacity."
he said less than half of texaco's oil supplies had been in
  jeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortages
  by mid-may.
now the situation appears much less severe, elton
  said.
it said that sonatrach, the algerian national oil company,
  canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas,
  occidental petroleum co &lt;oxy> demanded cash for crude, and
  atlantic richfield co &lt;arc> asked for special safeguards.
the company also said british petroleum co plc &lt;bp> last
  week refused to accept an order for fuel oil.
but yates today
  said, "a big u.k. company has in fact said they would go on
  supplying.
they had cancelled last week."
he declined to identify the company.
&lt;petroleos de venezuela s.a.>, the venezuelan state oil
  company that supplies a large portion of texaco's oil, also
  halted shipments two weeks ago, yates said.
but he added that texaco expected to meet with the
  venezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that key
  supply line.
talks were also expected to take place with the
  algerians, he added.
bankruptcy specialists said it was likely texaco's chapter
  11 filing would allow the company to secure its credit lines
  and oil supplies that are key to the company's business.
"it will be business as usual for texaco," said martin
  klein, a bankruptcy attorney at the new york law firm dreyer
  and traub.
"creditors are a nervous bunch of people," he said.
"but
  when the dust settles they will reevaluate the situation and
  will likely extend credit to the chapter 11 company."
but other officials at texaco were not immediately
  available to say whether discussions were being held with its
  banks, or whether credit lines had been reestablished.

gaf &lt;gaf> seeks information on borg-warner&lt;bor>
  gaf corp said it is exploring its

  all information that was supplied to merrill lynch.
a gaf spokesman said the company asked for the information
  in order to enable gaf to fully evaluate its alternatives.
the spokesman also confirmed that gaf did raise its bid to
  48 dlrs cash from 46 dlrs per share on friday.
merrill is offering 48.50 dlrs per share cash for 89 pct of
  borg-warner, and a package of cash and securities for the
  balance.
the transaction with merrill lynch will take borg-warner
  private in the form of a leveraged buyout.
merrill lynch does
  not intend to sell borg-warner assets, but it may be forced to
  do so in financing the deal, said sources familiar with the
  transaction.
borg-warner has said its management is not a participant
  in the transaction, but managers will retain their positions.
the investors involved with merrill include pension funds,
  insurance companies and other institutional investors, sources
  said.

abu dhabi marketing said not breaching opec pact
  a senior abu dhabi oil official said
  in remarks published today the emirate, largest producer in the
  united arab emirates (uae), was succeeding in marketing its
  crude oil without breaching opec accords.
khalaf al-oteiba, marketing director at the abu dhabi
  national oil co (adnoc), told the company's petroleum community
  magazine adnoc was also keen to keep good customer relations.
"the company will maintain its dialogue with and care for its
  customers in accordance with market conditions...and take
  necessary steps to guarantee marketing its production," he said.
"the present oil marketing policy of adnoc is based on
  adherence to opec decisions of december 1986 to control
  production and establish a new pricing system in an attempt to
  stabilize the market," he added.
opec agreed last december to limit production to 15.8 mln
  bpd and return to fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel.
oteiba said stabilization of the oil market in the future
  depended on how much discipline opec showed.
oteiba said last year, when world oil prices dropped, was
  adnoc's most difficult ever but "a practical and flexible
  pricing policy was implemented to relate to the changed market
  environment."
he said crude oil sales last year jumped to an average
  609,000 bpd of which 73 pct was exported.
refined product sales
  totalled eight mln metric tonnes, of which 67 pct was exported.
in 1985, adnoc marketed a total of 476,000 bpd of crude oil
  and 7.2 mln tonnes of refined products.

dome &lt;dmp> benefits from takeover speculation
  shares of dome petroleum ltd posted
  their biggest gain in months in the u.s. and canada as stock
  markets foresaw a takeover tug-of-war beginning for the
  debt-heavy company.
dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the american stock exchange and
  gained 31 cents to 1.44 canadian dlrs on the toronto stock
  exchange, where it was the most active stock.
it rose as high
  as 1.50 dlrs in toronto during the day.
in recent months, dome
  has normally moved by only a few cents per day.
transcanada pipelines yesterday announced a 4.3 billion dlr
  canadian (3.22 billion u.s.) bid for all of dome's assets, but
  dome, which is based in calgary, alberta, said it is also still
  talking with two other companies, which it refuses to identify.
market analysts today said the other two firms are believed
  to be foreign oil companies, noting that transcanada yesterday
  stressed that its bid is "a canadian solution to the financial
  difficulties of dome petroleum."
"the talk is about conoco, which is controlled by dupont
  &lt;dd>, and atlantic richfield co &lt;arc>, which sold its canadian
  interest in 1975 and could be getting back in," said wilf gobert
  of peters and co ltd.
      david bryson of moss lawson and co also noted that british
  petroleum plc &lt;bp> is mentioned as a possible buyer, despite
  bp's 70 u.s. dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the 45 percent
  of standard oil co &lt;srd> it does not already own.
calgary-based independent analyst james hamilton has said
  in recent reports that amoco corp &lt;an> has also been in talks
  with dome.
representatives of atlantic richfield, british petroleum,
  conoco and amoco were not immediately available for comment.
gobert characterized the market action in dome today as "awfully
  optimistic," given transcanada's offer to give current dome
  shareholders stock in a new subsidiary, which it valued at 1.10
  dlrs canadian per common share.
under the offer, current dome common and preferred
  shareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, which
  would own and operate all dome's former assets.
transcanada
  would own 80 pct.
however, bryson said the market may be looking at the
  potential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary.
"the
  transcanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for dome,"
  he said.
gobert said he believes the transcanada offer is "at the
  upper end of what i thought somebody would pay for dome."
the transcanada proposal would pay dome's creditors 3.87
  billion canadian dlrs (2.90 billion u.s. dlrs), with another
  one billion canadian dlrs (750 mln u.s. dlrs) available to
  secured creditors if the dome subsidiary earns profits above a
  certain level.
transcanada would not detail the profit level.
dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billion
  canadian dlrs (4.5 billion u.s. dlrs) in debt, which it took on
  several years ago when oil prices were high and the company
  wanted to expand.
"there has been speculation that dome's assets are capable
  of supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on that
  basis, the transcanada offer would be at the upper end of that,"
  gobert said.
dome's debt troubles have often obscured the fact that it
  is a major player in the canadian oil and gas field.
it holds
  reserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billion
  cubic feet of natural gas.
the company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acres
  of oil and gas exploration land in the province of alberta, the
  heart of canada's oil industry.
dome owns or has an interest in a total of 36.1 mln acres of
  land across canada.
the company also has tax credits of about 2.5 billion dlrs
  canadian (1.9 billion dlrs u.s.).
it reported a 1986 loss of
  2.2 billion dlrs (1.65 billion dlrs u.s.), believed to be the
  largest ever by a canadian company.

texaco filing adds uncertainty in oil market
  u.s. oil traders said texaco inc's
  filing for protection under the chapter 11 bankruptcy code is
  adding uncertainty to an already skittish oil market, but
  opinions are divided on the impact to the market.
"the filing is holding up wet barrel trading today," said
  one trader.
"everyone is talking about it, assessing their
  company's situations in relation to texaco," he added.
some traders said companies that deal with texaco are
  concerned about whether they will receive payment or supplies
  under the bankruptcy filing.
however, others were less worried.
"the first paid will be
  the trading community and those connected with texaco in the
  shipping industry," one new york trader said.
"if texaco doesn't get crude supplies it can't run its
  refineries, so its other assets would not be worth anything,"
  he added.
texaco filed for protection under chapter 11 of the u.s.
  bankruptcy code yesterday after failing to reach a settlement
  with pennzoil on an 11 billion dlrs court award for illegally
  interferring with pennzoil's proposed purchase of getty oil co.
however, others were less worried.
"the first paid will be
  the trading community and those connected with texaco in the

  bankruptcy code yesterday after failing to reach a settlement
  with pennzoil on an 11 billion dlrs court award for illegally
  interferring with pennzoil's proposed purchase of getty oil co.
      "there is some reluctance to trade with texaco but no great
  change," said another trader, adding that traders are tending
  toward prudence in their dealings with the company.
traders are assessing whether to require cash prepayment or
  letters of credit, or to continue to trade as usual with texaco
  on an open line basis, he said.
another trader, however, described today's activity as
  business as usual, adding that traders feel more secure because
  no liens can be put on texaco's assets while it is in
  bankruptcy.
traders said there was no apparent effect of the texaco
  filing on crude futures trading although they said the exchange
  might lower texaco's position limit and require higher margins
  for texaco's trades.
new york mercantile exchange president rosemary mcfadden
  declined to comment on texaco's futures trading, saying that is
  is proprietary information.
mcfadden did say, however, that as
  a matter of procedure, it is possible the exchange can lower
  allowable position limits or increase margin requirements for
  companies that are in financial trouble.

merrill to get 30 mln dlr fee in borg &lt;bor> deal
  merrill lynch and co inc &lt;mer>
  subsidiary seeking to take over of borg-warner corp said it
  could realize a 30 mln dlr fee for its efforts, whether or not
  the deal, which it values at 4.7 billion dlrs, succeeds.
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission,
  merrill lynch capital partners inc said it would receive a 30
  mln dlr fee from the surviving company for acting as dealer
  manager of the merger after the borg-warner deal is completed.
but it said it could also receive a break-up fee of 30 mln
  dlrs if the deal fails for reasons, which include another party
  holding more than 40 pct of its stock or tendering for 50 pct.
the 30 mln dlr fee is among the highest set down in any
  tender offer agreement, either in compensation for dealer
  manager services or for break-up of the deal.
merrill lynch capital markets, backed by a group of
  investors it organized, has launched a 48.50 dlr a share tender
  offer for borg-warner for 90 pct of its stock.
the company's board has approved the plan, which was
  intended to thwart an unsolicited offer from gaf corp.
      borg-warner also agreed to redeem all outstanding series a
  preferred shares and to pay off on all options at a 48.50 dlr a
  share exercise price before the merger is effective, it said.
merrill lynch said its representatives discussed a possible
  leveraged buyout with borg-warner as early as last december.
at that time, merrill lynch told the company it would
  consider a 43 dlr a share tender offer in cash and securities,
  if the borg-warner board approved, it said.
on feb 24, it said
  it was told the company had decided against a buyout.
but talks were revived after gaf launched its 46 dlr a
  share proposal on march 31, merrill lynch said.
unlike its earlier proposal, merrill lynch said borg-warner
  management was asked not to take part in the new deal and it
  was conditioned upon payment of the fees.
in addition to its fees, merrill lynch said it will also
  get up to 17 mln dlrs from borg-warner to cover its expenses in
  the tender offer.
merrill lynch said it would continue operating borg-warner
  as a subsidiary with its current officers keeping their
  positions.
but for flexibility purposes, merrill lynch said it is
  considering redistributing borg-warner's assets to a number of
  subsdiaries of an entity it created to carry out the merger.
all in all merrill lynch estimated that there would be 130
  mln dlrs in fees and expenses connected with the deal.
another 250 mln dlrs will be needed to repay certain debt
  of borg-warner, merrill lynch said.
to finance the deal, merrill lynch said it expects to
  borrow 3.5 billion dlrs from a group of banks and sell 100 mln
  dlrs of common stock of the new company, sell 100 mln dlrs of
  non-voting preferred stock of the new company to merrill lynch
  and co, sell up to 650 mln dlrs of subordinated notes to
  merrill lynch and co and sell to the public 204 mln dlrs of
  subordinated discount debentures.
gaf has raised its offer to 48 dlrs a share cash.

ecuador says will resume limited oil production
  ecuador will resume limited crude output
  next week to fill up storage tanks as a first step to pump oil
  to a colombian pipeline on may one, the state ecuadorean
  petroleum corp (cepe) said.
cepe manager carlos romoleroux told reporters that ecuador
  would begin pumping an unspecified amount of crude in
  northeastern jungle oilfields at the end of next week in
  preparation to send the oil through a new pipeline link-up to
  neighbouring colombia.
oil production in ecuador was halted on march five when an
  earthquake damaged the country's main pipeline from lago agrio,
  at the heart of the ecuadorean jungle oilfields, to the pacific
  port of balao.
it will take at least until the end of july to repair the
  pipeline and return output to normal levels.
the country was
  pumping between 245,000 bpd and 250,000 bpd before the tremor.
to resume limited output in the meantime, ecuador is
  constructing a 26 mile pipeline linkup, capable of carrying
  55,000 bpd, from lago agrio to puerto colon, the starting point
  of colombia's pipeline to the pacific port of tumaco.
the original target date to resume limited crude output was
  may eight, the scheduled date for the inauguration of the lago
  agrio to puerto colon pipeline, an energy ministry spokesman
  said.
new zealand cpi rises 2.3 pct in march quarter
  new zealand's consumer price index,
  cpi, which measures the rate of inflation, rose 2.3 pct in the
  quarter ended march 31 against an 8.9 pct rise in the december
  1986 quarter and a 2.3 pct rise in the march 1986 quarter, the
  statistics department said.
for the 12 months ended march 1987 the cpi rose 18.3 pct
  against 18.2 pct in 12 months ended december 1986 and 13.0 pct
  in the 12 months ended march 1986, it said in a statement.
nearly half the increase in the latest quarterly index was
  contributed by the housing group, the department said.
the december quarter was significantly affected by the
  introduction of a 10 pct value added goods and services tax,
  gst, in october 1986, it added.
however, some gst charges not measured in the december 1986
  quarter influenced the latest march quarterly figure, it said.
this is because of an unavoidable lag in price information,
  particularly on housing, used cars and insurance on household
  contents, it added.

bank of japan intervenes in tokyo after opening
  the bank of japan intervened in tokyo to
  buy dollars just after the market opened, dealers said.
the dollar opened at 142.05 yen against 142.15/25 in new

miyazawa sees eventual lower u.s. trade deficit
  japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa
  told a press conference he expects the u.s. trade deficit to
  eventually start reflecting economic fundamentals, which should
  influence exchange rates.
the minister was not referring to the u.s. trade data to be
  released in washington later today.
miyazawa also said he told major industrial nations when he
  was in washington last week that present exchange rates are not
  necessarily good.
he had said earlier in washington that
  current exchange rates were within levels implied in the
  february paris currency accord.

no talks set on proposed japan telecom merger
  no formal talks have been scheduled yet
  among companies involved in a controversial proposal to merge
  two groups seeking to enter japan's international
  telecommunications sector, an official from one group said.
"nothing has been firmed up yet," said an official at
  &lt;international digital communications planning inc> (idc), one
  of the groups set up last year to study competing against
  &lt;kokusai denshin denwa co ltd>, which monopolises the sector.
britain's cable and wireless plc &lt;cawl.l>, which holds a 20
  pct share in idc, has opposed plans to merge with rival group,
  &lt;international telecom japan inc>.
under the plan, backed by the post and telecommunications
  ministry, cable and wireless and u.s.-based &lt;pacific telesis
  international inc> would become core companies in the merged
  firm, with shares equal to those of the six major japanese core
  companies and seats on the board of directors.
britain, angry over what it feels are moves to restrict
  cable and wireless' role in the sector, views the issue as a
  test case.
the idc official declined to specify what was
  holding up the talks.
a spokesman for c. itoh and co ltd &lt;citt.t>, which holds 20
  pct of idc, said a meeting may be held later this week.
haitian cane planters protest sugar mill closure
  about 2,000 sugar cane planters
  marched to port-au-prince to protest against the closure of
  haiti's largest sugar mill and second biggest employer.
the haitian american sugar company closed on friday because
  of a huge surplus of unsold sugar.
the firm said haiti has been
  flooded with smuggled refined and unrefined sugar from the
  dominican republic and refined u.s. sugar from miami.
the closure idled 3,500 factory workers and left 30,000
  small cane planters with no outlet for their cane.
the
  protesters blamed finance minister lesly delatour for the
  closure, saying his policies have hurt haitian businesses.
china to open first phase of large aluminium plant
  china, a major aluminium importer, will
  open the first phase of its biggest aluminium plant on october
  1, the china daily said.
the first phase of the plant, located in qinghai province,
  will have an annual capacity of 100,000 tonnes of ingots, half
  the capacity of the finished plant.
it will turn out 4,000
  tonnes in 1987, the paper said, but gave no more details.
construction of the 510 mln yuan plant began in april 1984.
customs figures show china imported 266,241 tonnes of
  aluminium and alloy in 1986, down from 487,862 in 1985.
taiwan imports 210,000 tonnes south african maize
  taiwan imported about 210,000 tonnes of
  south african maize between january 1 and april 13, the joint
  committee of local maize importers said.
under a three-year agreement signed last year, south africa
  will export 600,000 tonnes of maize a year to taiwan.
a committee spokesman told reuters the rest of this year's
  quota will be shipped during the rest of 1987.
taiwan likely to buy more u.s. soybeans
  a 50 pct cut in the import tariff for
  soybeans should help boost 1987 u.s.
soybean exports to taiwan,
  a spokesman for the joint committee of soybean importers told
  reuters.
he said the cut to 3.5 from seven pct was approved by the
  cabinet yesterday and would go into effect within a week.
the cut will encourage local importers to increase 1987
  soybean imports to 1.9 mln tonnes from 1.74 mln last year, he
  said.
the previous target for 1987 was 1.81 tonnes.
taiwan imports more than 90 pct of its soybeans from the
  u.s. and the rest from south america.
the spokesman said the increase in imports from the u.s. is
  in line with government efforts to reduce taiwan's trade
  surplus with washington, which rose to 3.61 billion u.s. dlrs
  in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78 billion a year ago.
"the tariff cut is very helpful for american suppliers (who
  want) to boost their exports to taiwan," steve chen, country
  director of the american soybean association, told reuters.
china faces extended sorghum shortage
  china will be short of sorghum in 1987
  for the sixth successive year because high production costs and
  low profits discourage farmers from growing it, the china daily
  business weekly said.
it said sorghum output in calendar 1986 was 5.34 mln
  tonnes, down five pct from the 1985 level, and prices on the
  free market rose in january to 0.42 yuan per kg, up 14 pct on
  january 1986.
it said sorghum acreage in 1987 is six pct lower than in
  1986.
sorghum accounts for 40 pct of the raw materials needed
  by china's breweries, it added but gave no more details.

  japan's broadly defined money supply
  average of m-2 plus certificate of deposits (cd) rose a
  preliminary 9.0 pct in march from a year earlier, compared with
  an 8.8 pct rise in february, the bank of japan said.
the seasonally adjusted march average of m-2 plus cds rose
  0.8 pct from february when it rose an identical 0.8 pct from a
  month earlier, it said.
unadjusted m-2 plus cds stood at an average 343,600 billion

south korea to change policies to avert trade war
  south korea has decided on major changes
  in its trade, investment and finance policies aimed at reducing
  the growth of its balance of payments surplus and avoiding a
  trade war with the united states, deputy prime minister kim
  mahn-je said.
kim told reporters the excessively fast rise in exports
  could make south korea too reliant on exports, increase
  nflation and produce trade friction.
the policy shift, which
  means abandoning seoul's goal of rapidly reducing its foreign
  debt, was worked out at a series of ministerial meetings.
kim, who is also economic planning minister, said the
  current account surplus, previously expected to exceed eight
  billion dlrs this year, would be held at about five billion
  dlrs by increasing imports, accelerating market liberalisation
  and rationalising exports.
he said seoul would try to limit its current account
  surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next few
  years, although trade volume would continue to grow.
"this will gradually reduce the ratio of the surplus to gnp
  (gross national product) from the current five pct level to
  three pct by 1991," he added.
koo bon-yong, an aide to kim, said south korea's foreign
  debt had been expected to fall below 40 billion dlrs by the end
  of 1987, against the initial forecast of 41.8 billion, and 44.5
  billion dlrs at end-1986.
"but now (with the policy changes) the debt is expected to
  remain above 40 billion dlrs, although it could still be lower
  than the originally projected 41.8 billion dlrs," he said.
the policy change was announced two days before the
  scheduled arrival of u.s. commerce secretary malcolm baldrige
  for talks with trade minister rha woong-bae.
south korea is under u.s. pressure to reduce its bilateral
  trade surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs last year from
  4.3 billion dlrs in 1985.
kim said the policy changes were also prompted by the swing
  in south korea's current account to a surplus of 2.06 billion
  dlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from a deficit of 438 mln
  dlrs in the same 1986 period.
first quarter 1987 exports rose
  36 pct to 9.4 billion dlrs.
the government would make foreign currency loans worth 2.5
  billion dlrs to firms willing to import capital goods, raw
  materials and equipment, preferably from the u.s., he said.
"the foreign currency-based loans, which carry interest at
  1.5 points above libor (london interbank offered rate), are
  considerable incentives given to increase imports," koo said.
koo said the loans would be repayable in foreign currency.
"it means they could become interest-free loans if the korean
  currency continues to rise in value," he said.
he said the south korean won would be revalued against the
  dollar gradually, but added "we do not believe in rapid one-shot
  changes in the value of the won."
the won, fixed at 839.70 to the dollar today, has risen six
  pct against the dollar since the beginning of 1986.
bank of china buys share in luxembourg company
  state-owned bank of china has bought a
  three to five pct share of baii holding sa, a financial
  institution registered in luxembourg, the china daily business
  weekly said.
it said the institution is 50 pct owned by arab interests
  and has set up a wholly owned commercial banking branch in hong
  kong but gave no more details.
saudi arabia wants to increase oil sales to japan
  saudi arabia hopes to increase the volume
  of its oil exports to japan through expanding bilateral trade,
  saudi arabian interior minister naif bin abdul-aziz said.
he told a tokyo reception his country hopes to raise crude
  and products exports to japan to earlier levels, but did not
  elaborate.
to promote trade, saudi arabia is inviting japanese
  industries to do business there, he said.
japanese firms now have long-term contracts to import a
  total of 150,000 barrels per day of saudi crude.
u.s. urges japan to open farm market further
  u.s. agriculture secretary richard lyng
  has asked japan to open its farm market further to help
  washington cut its trade deficit and ease protectionist
  pressures, an agriculture ministry official told reporters.
hideo maki, director general of the ministry's economic
  affairs bureau, quoted lyng as telling agriculture minister
  mutsuki kato that the removal of import restrictions would help
  japan as well as the united states.
the meeting with kato opened a 12-day visit to japan by
  lyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade.
however, maki quoted kato as replying that japan was
  already the world's largest grain importer.
kato added japan is the largest customer for u.s.
grain and
  depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food
  requirements in 1985.
lyng said the u.s.
put high priority on talks on 12 farm
  products named in u.s.
complaints against japan to the general
  agreement on tariffs and trade (gatt) last year, as well as on
  beef, citrus products and rice.
kato said japan will maintain its current level of
  self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice
  because potential production is higher than domestic demand.
the world farm market suffers from surpluses because of
  rising production by exporting countries, he added.
lyng said the u.s. has been trying to reduce farm product
  output with expensive programs, maki said.
maki said the u.s. and japan will hold detailed discussions
  on each trade item as well as a new round of gatt trade talks
  at a meeting on april 20, in which u.s. trade representative
  clayton yeutter will join.
60,000 tonnes corn smuggled into philippines-paper
  at least 60,000 tonnes of corn worth 240
  mln pesos have been smuggled into the philippines over the past
  few months, the manila bulletin newspaper said, quoting an
  official in the national food authority (nfa).
the official, who was not named, said a large corn shortage
  and corruption among customs and coast guard personnel have
  jeopardised the government's ban on corn imports, which was
  aimed at saving foreign currency.
the newspaper quoted nfa marketing director jig tan as
  saying monthly corn consumption stood at about 331,000 tonnes
  against a national stock inventory of 191,732 tonnes.
tan said a continuing drought affecting about 49,150
  hectares of corn has led to the loss of 43,725 tonnes of corn
  worth 174.9 mln pesos and contributed to the shortage.
the newspaper quoted linda geraldez, an nfa statistician,
  as saying despite the drought and the shortage, the total
  inventory at the end of the january/june crop season is
  expected to be at least 201,000 tonnes.
paper says u.s. trade deficit cut to 13.65 billion
  the washington post said the u.s.
  commerce department yesterday issued a new report showing that
  the u.s.
merchandise trade deficit was 13.65 billion dollars in
  february, a reduction of 1.4 billion dlrs from the 15.06
  billion figure the department reported only two days earlier.
the newspaper said: "news of the unexpectedly large 15
  billion deficit helped batter the dollar's value on foreign
  exchange markets and boosted u.s. interest rates.
"however, the new report went largely unnoticed by financial
  markets since such a downward revision in the deficit is a
  monthly occurrence."
the washington post said: "by law, the department must first
  publish what a top commerce official agreed are misleading
  trade figures and then wait 48 hours before putting out the
  more accurate ones."
no one was immediately available at the commerce department
  for comment on the washington post report.
south korea's leading indicators rise in february
  south korea's index of leading indicators
  rose 1.9 pct to 172.9 (base 1980) in february after a 0.8 pct
  rise in january, to stand 17.2 pct higher than in feburary
  1986, provisional economic planning board figures show.
the index is based on 10 indicators which include export
  values, letters of credit received, warehouse stocks, m-1 and
  m-3 money supply figures and the composite stock exchange
  index.
japan's ldp to call for flexible monetary policies
  japan's ruling liberal democratic party
  (ldp) will call for adequate and flexible management of the
  nation's monetary polices in its plan to expand domestic
  demand, a senior ldp official told reuters.
junichiro koizumi, the head of the ldp committee working
  out the plan, said the phrase should not be taken as implying
  an immediate cut in japan's 2.5 pct discount rate.
"the ldp generally believes that there is no need for a
  further discount rate cut at the moment," he said.
but koizumi
  said the ldp does not rule out a rate cut if necessary in the
  future.
bank of japan governor satoshi sumita told a press
  conference on wednesday that the central bank does not have any
  intention of easing credit conditions.
india's annual inflation rate drops marginally
  the finance ministry said india's
  wholesale-price linked inflation rate dropped marginally to 5.3
  pct in all fiscal 1986/87 ended march from 5.8 pct in 1985/86
  and 7.1 pct in 1984/85.
the average wholesale-price related inflation stood at 5.2
  pct in march this year against 5.1 pct a year ago, the ministry
  said in a statement.
it said wholesale prices of cement, textiles and jute fell
  in 1986/87, compared with the previous year, but milk, cereals
  (mainly wheat and rice), fruits and vegetables, edible oils,
  tobacco and fertilisers were costlier in 1986/87.
japan details plan to stave off trade problems
  japan's liberal democratic party (ldp)
  has drawn up a detailed plan calling for large tax cuts and an
  increase in government purchases of foreign goods, the head of
  the committee working out the plan, junichiro koizumi, said.
the plan will also urge the government to double 1985's
  official development assistance to 7.6 billion dlrs within five
  years instead of seven as the government had promised, senior
  ldp officials said at a press conference.
ldp executive council chairman shintaro abe will explain
  the plan to u.s. officials when he visits the u.s. on april 19.
abe's visit is to prepare for prime minister yasuhiro
  nakasone's talks with president ronald reagan later this month.
koizumi said the ldp plan will not specify the size of the
  tax cut or the amount of domestic demand to be stimulated.
however, top ldp executives will work out figures so that abe
  will be able to offer specifics to u.s. officials.
the proposed increase in procurement of foreign goods by
  the government will probably include the purchase of super
  computers, ldp officials said.
specific trade problems with other nations and will encourage
  flows of funds to developing countries, the officials said.
the ldp expects the measures to prop up the economy and
  lessen trade problems with the u.s., they added.
the basic ideas of the ldp's plan were presented to and
  welcomed by monetary authorities of the major industrial
  nations in washington last week, they said.
the ldp plan will form the basis for the last of several
  packages to stimulate japanese domestic demand and will be
  unveiled by the government in late may.
china trade deficit falls sharply, reserves rise
  china's trade deficit in the first
  quarter fell to 1.05 billion dlrs from 3.04 billion in the same
  1986 period, customs figures show.
zhang zhongji, spokesman of the state statistical bureau,
  quoted the figures as showing exports rose 27 pct to 7.28
  billion dlrs and imports fell 5.1 pct to 8.33 billion.
he said if imports of gifts, foreign aid items and
  materials for joint ventures are excluded, the deficit was only
  350 mln dlrs, and the surplus on invisibles was 700 mln.
as a
  result, foreign exchange reserves increased somewhat from their
  level at end-1986, he said, but gave no figure.
official figures show the reserves at 10.514 billion dlrs
  at end-1986, down from 11.9 billion at end-1985.
zhang said one reason for the rise in exports was improved
  incentives to export firms, which are being allowed to retain
  more foreign exchange from the goods they sell.
he said first quarter exports to hong kong and macao rose
  35.5 pct to 2.48 billion dlrs and imports rose 55.3 pct to 1.46
  billion.
exports to japan fell 2.3 pct to 1.28 billion and
  imports 24.4 pct to 2.14 billion.
exports to the u.s. rose 23 pct to 640 mln dlrs and imports
  fell 26.7 pct to 840 mln.
exports to the eec rose 35.1 pct to
  770 mln dlrs and imports fell 3.8 pct to 1.5 billion, he said.
thai venture will sell rubber to china
  teck soon co ltd, a major thai rubber
  exporter has formed a joint venture with state-owned chinese
  international economic and technology development corp to
  produce 50,000 tonnes of sheet rubber annually for export to
  the chinese auto industry, teck soon general manager chit
  surivitchpan said.
chit said a new joint venture company will have a
  registered capital of four mln dlrs.
china imported 69,952 tonnes of thai sheet rubber last year
  and 60,296 tonnes in 1985.
japan farm reform a key to trimming trade surplus
  basic reform of japan's protected farm
  sector is a key to shifting its economy away from export to
  domestic-led growth, a vital step if it is to trim its trade
  surplus, securities analysts said.
the farm sector, which is protected by import tariffs and
  quotas, propped up by subsidies and price supports, and
  sheltered by the tax system, has ample room for change, they
  said.
"in economic terms, reform would be a plus," said christopher
  chew of brokerage firm james capel and co.
the ultimate cost of the existing system is food prices
  twice those in europe and two to three times those in the u.s.,
  the analysts said.
spending on food accounts for about one quarter of the
  average household's budget and roughly 10 pct of the gross
  national product (gnp), according to a study by chew.
reducing these prices could increase household spending
  power by five pct, his study said.
the money could be spent on
  products which would have a more direct impact in boosting
  domestic growth, it added.
"there's a lot of slack," a u.s. government official in tokyo
  said.
"all that money could be spent on something else."
direct central government subsidies to the farm sector
  amount to some five billion dlrs per year.
independent
  estimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37
  billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted.
changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farm
  on weekends to put their land up for sale for residential
  development would also give a boost to domestic spending,
  economists said.
"housing construction is the key strategic variable in the
  expansion of domestic demand," wrote chihiro nakajima, professor
  at kyoto gakuen university.
japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reform
  to shift some of the burden of trade friction and economic
  restructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto the
  farm sector.
employers groups also want change.
"if you really
  want to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not to
  raise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices," bumpei
  otsuki, president of the japan federation of employers'
  associations told a recent press conference.
external pressures are rising as the u.s. and europe seek
  removal of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their trade
  deficits with japan.
but vested japanese interests opposed to change remain well
  entrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said.
although the full-time farm population is falling and there
  are signs the ldp is paying more attention to urban
  constituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent on
  farm votes in the rural areas.
one rural vote is worth several
  city votes due to the pattern of constituency borders.
the ldp is already in political trouble over its tax reform
  plan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon,
  the analysts said.
consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept the
  traditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay for
  national food security, they said.
powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed to
  import liberalisation, but are more flexible about reforms
  aimed at stepping up productivity, they said.
reform, when it comes, will be in response to specific
  pressure rather than an all-embracing program, said chew.
japan sees higher money supply growth this quarter
  the bank of japan said it forecast
  japan's broadly-defined m-2 money supply average plus
  certificates of deposit (cds) will rise by about nine pct in
  the current april-june quarter against 8.5 pct a year earlier.
unadjusted m-2 plus cds rose a preliminary 8.8 pct in
  january/march 1987 compared with a nine pct rise a year
  earlier, it said.
the bank said the forecast rise is due to an increase in
  floating deposits due to recent low interest rates and a shift
  to private banks from the bank of japan of 400-1,000 billion
  yen by the recently privatised japanese railways.
oecd consumer prices rise in february
  consumer prices in the countries of the
  organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd)
  rose 0.3 pct in february and inflation rose to 2.4 pct
  year-on-year, the oecd said in a communique.
the oecd attributed the rise in consumer prices to the
  effects of the february 1986 drop in energy prices working
  their way out of the index.
the february increase was less than
  janauary's 0.4 pct increase but slightly above the average for
  the later months of 1986.
inflation in the 24 western industrialised nations in
  january was a revised 1.9 pct year-on-year.
retail energy prices rose by 0.3 pct, less than january's
  1.1 pct increase.
energy prices for consumers were still nine
  pct lower than a year earlier, it said.
consumer prices excluding food and energy rose 0.3 pct in
  february, in line with previous months, although there has been
  some acceleration noticeable in the u.s. and britain.
among the leading seven industrial countries, consumer
  price inflation was highest in italy at 4.2 pct, followed by
  canada at 4.0 pct, britain at 3.9 pct, france at 3.4 pct, the
  u.s. at 2.1 pct and west germany and japan with negative rates
  of 0.5 pct and 1.4 pct respectively.
lyng opens japan talks on farm trade barriers
  u.s. agriculture secretary richard lyng
  opens talks with japanese government officials today well aware
  his demand for the opening of japanese rice, beef and citrus
  markets is likely to be rejected.
but in an interview with reuters during the flight to
  tokyo yesterday, lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw an
  international spotlight on japan's agricultural import
  protection in the hope pressure would build on tokyo to open
  its markets.
"(the japanese) have said they are happy we are coming, but
  they are not going to give us anything," lyng said.
u.s. officials do not expect any japanese concessions
  during lyng's two-week visit here.
any farm trade concessions
  would be unveiled later this month, they said.
"if there is anything of consequence to offer (prime
  minister yasuhiro) nakasone would take it with him," when he
  visits washington later in the month, one u.s. official said.
lyng plans to ask japan to open the door to rice imports by
  partially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases.
a private u.s. rice trader visited tokyo last week
  requesting japan buy 200,000 tonnes of rice for industrial uses
  such as making sake.
japan has rejected the overture, saying
  tokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice.
lyng will also press japan to eliminate an import quota for
  beef by april 1988 because he believes japanese consumers would
  like to buy much more beef than currently allowed.
he cited the example of a california company which
  transports live u.s. cattle to japan by air for slaughter to
  circumvent the beef quota.
the cost of transport is higher than
  the value of the animal, he said.
u.s. officials said the japan livestock industry promotion
  corporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrow
  from the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986
  quota was exhausted and japanese beef prices were rising.
japan
  has said it cannot open its markets to beef imports.
along with beef, the u.s. will also press japan to
  eliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice by
  april, 1988.
some u.s. officials believe japan may eventually
  be willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because
  liberalized trade would not necessarily damage the japanese
  mandarin orange industry.
the quota on juice may be harder to eliminate because
  imports might replace domestic produced juice, u.s. and
  japanese officials have said.
lyng has resurrected a past u.s. proposal that japan buy
  surplus u.s. foodgrains for donation to developing countries,
  but some u.s. officials are skeptical action will be taken.
lyng will also urge japan to put its domestic farm policies,
  including rice, on the negotiating table during gatt talks in
  geneva.
he said japan must eliminate import quotas on certain
  minor food products or face possible u.s. reprisals.
japan details plan to stave off trade problems
  japan's liberal democratic party (ldp)
  has drawn up a detailed plan calling for large tax cuts and an
  increase in government purchases of foreign goods, the head of
  the committee working out the plan, junichiro koizumi, said.
the plan will also urge the government to double 1985's
  official development assistance to 7.6 billion dlrs within five
  years instead of seven as the government had promised, senior
  ldp officials said at a press conference.
ldp executive council chairman shintaro abe will explain
  the plan to u.s. officials when he visits the u.s. on april 19.
abe's visit is to prepare for prime minister yasuhiro
  nakasone's talks with president ronald reagan later this month.
koizumi said the ldp plan will not specify the size of the
  tax cut or the amount of domestic demand to be stimulated.
however, top ldp executives will work out figures so that abe
  will be able to offer specifics to u.s. officials.
the proposed increase in procurement of foreign goods by
  the government will probably include the purchase of super
  computers, ldp officials said.
according to the plan, japan will also strive to solve
  specific trade problems with other nations and will encourage
  flows of funds to developing countries, the officials said.
the ldp expects the measures to prop up the economy and
  lessen trade problems with the u.s., they added.
the basic ideas of the ldp's plan were presented to and
  welcomed by monetary authorities of the major industrial
  nations in washington last week, they said.
the ldp plan will form the basis for the last of several
  packages to stimulate japanese domestic demand and will be
  unveiled by the government in late may.
baldrige to launch far east trade drive
  u.s. commerce secretary malcolm
  baldrige leaves on saturday on a 10-day trip to the far east to
  help spur u.s. trade and improve business relations with china,
  south korea and the philippines, u.s. officials say.
baldrige will also stop in hong kong to meet british
  officials and local u.s. and hong kong businessmen.
the u.s. last year had major deficits with three of its
  asian trading partners -- south korea 7.1 billion dlrs, hong
  kong 6.4 billion and china 2.1 billion.
the deficit with the
  philippines was 800 mln dlrs.
baldrige will meet south korean president chun doo-hwan and
  trade minister rha woong bae on monday to discuss opening south
  korean markets to more u.s. goods.
baldrige will be in peking from april 21 to 24.
he will
  meet zheng tuobin, minister for foreign economic relations and
  trade, attend a meeting of the u.s.-china joint commission on
  commerce and trade and address a management and training
  organisation.
however, u.s. officials said a chief purpose of baldrige's
  visit would be to discuss relaxed u.s. rules for transferring
  modern technology to chinese industries.
in hong kong, baldrige will hold meetings on april 27 with
  governor david wilson and trade and industry secretary eric ho,
  as well as addressing the american chamber of commerce.
u.s. officials said baldrige will meet philippines
  president corazon aquino on april 28 to show continued u.s.
  support for her government and to discuss steps it could take
  to improve the atmosphere for american investment.
he will also will meet finance secretary jaime ongpin and
  trade and industry secretary jose concepcion.
u.s. urges japan to open farm market further
  u.s. agriculture secretary richard lyng
  has asked japan to open its farm market further to help
  washington cut its trade deficit and ease protectionist
  pressures, an agriculture ministry official told reporters.
hideo maki, director general of the ministry's economic
  affairs bureau, quoted lyng as telling agriculture minister
  mutsuki kato that the removal of import restrictions would help
  japan as well as the united states.
the meeting with kato opened a 12-day visit to japan by
  lyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade.
however, maki quoted kato as replying that japan was
  already the world's largest grain importer.
kato added japan is the largest customer for u.s.
grain and
  depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food
  requirements in 1985.
lyng said the u.s.
put high priority on talks on 12 farm
  products named in u.s.
complaints against japan to the general
  agreement on tariffs and trade (gatt) last year, as well as on
  beef, citrus products and rice.
kato said japan will maintain its current level of
  self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice
  because potential production is higher than domestic demand.
the world farm market suffers from surpluses because of
  rising production by exporting countries, he added.
lyng said the u.s. has been trying to reduce farm product
  output with expensive programs, maki said.
maki said the u.s. and japan will hold detailed discussions
  on each trade item as well as a new round of gatt trade talks
  at a meeting on april 20, in which u.s. trade representative
  clayton yeutter will join.
federated guaranty &lt;fdgc.o> sets stock split
  federated guaranty corp said
  its board declared a two-for-one stock split and raised the
  quarterly dividend to 6-1/2 cts per share post-split from six
  cts, both payable june one, record may 15.
the company said shareholders at the annual meeting
  approved an increase in authorized common shares to 19 mln from
  10 mln and a name change to alfa corp.
it said the name change
  should take effect next week, along with a nasdaq ticker symbol
  change to &lt;alfa.o>.
reagan to announce decision on japan sanctions
  president reagan today is to
  announce a decision on tough new tariffs on japanese exports to
  retaliate for what he calls japan's failure to end its unfair
  practices in semiconductor trade.
the 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs of
  japanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel of
  experts headed by the u.s. trade representative's office.
reagan announced last march 27 he would impose the tariffs
  on certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computors
  and television sets to power tools and photographic film.
the panel this week winnowed through the list of the some
  20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to santa
  barbara, where reagan is vacationing.
in his march annoucement, reagan said "i am committed to
  full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide
  american industry with free and fair trade opportunities."
he added the tariffs would be lifted once japan honored the
  pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world
  markets and opened its home market to u.s. products.
u.s. officials said japan had done nothing since the march
  announcement to alter reagan's plan to invoke the sanctions.
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said yesterday:  "we
  do not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind of
  action that requires meaningful action."
reagan's move follows steadily rising u.s. trade deicits,
  with last year's hitting a record $169.8 billion.
about one-third of the deficit is in trade with japan.
congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president to
  retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices.
he has opposed the legislation, saying it would prevent
  negotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, that
  existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices.
trade experts say his tough action against the japanese was
  as much to penalize the japanese as to show congress he did not
  need any new trade legislation.
the japanese have complained that they have been honoring
  the semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before the
  results showed up.
u.s. officials, however, have said their monitoring of
  japanese semiconductor shipments to east asian countries and
  western europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the
  japanese home markets remained shut to american exports.
japan has said that if reagan imposed the tariffs, it would
  file a complaint with the general agreement on tariff and trade
  (gatt).
it said hoped gatt would find the u.s. retaliation had
  violated the regulations of the global trading group and would
  approve compensation or japanese retaliation.
u.s. officials have said they did not think japan would
  retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with
  the united states.

amoco &lt;an> may buy dome &lt;dmp>, report says
  amoco corp is apparently the successful
  bidder for debt-laden dome petroleum ltd, according to a
  published report.
the toronto globe and mail, quoting sources close to the
  negotiations, today said dome broke off talks last night with
  transcanada pipelines ltd, which last week announced a 4.3
  billion canadian dlr offer for all of dome's assets.
no financial details about the amoco offer were available
  and a dome spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that amoco
  had emerged the winner, the newspaper said.
however, the dome spokesman indicated that the sale of dome
  could be finalized and announced this weekend, the globe and
  mail said.
representatives of amoco were not immediately available for
  comment.
last sunday, when transcanada announced its offer, dome
  said it was also in talks with two other companies, but refused
  to identify them.
since then, market speculation has centered on amoco and
  exxon corp's &lt;xon> 70 pct-owned imperial oil ltd subsidiary in
  canada.
british petroleum plc &lt;bp> and royal dutch/shell group &lt;rd>
  have also been mentioned as possible suitors for dome.
in the past two days, dome management has been pressured by
  the federal government to select the offer from transcanada,
  the only canadian company in the bidding.
prime minister brian mulroney's government appears to want
  to avoid a dome sale to a foreign company since the government
  gave dome hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to
  encourage oil and gas exploration in the arctic, analysts and
  officials have said.
a purchase by transcanada would be least likely to run
  afoul of canadian antitrust laws, however, transcanada is
  asking for tax concessions from a federal government that is
  trying to hold its deficit below 30 billion canadian dlrs,
  analysts have said.
a takeover by amoco or imperial would also give a foreign
  oil company a dominant position in canada's oil industry.
imperial oil is already canada's largest energy company,
  with 1986 revenues of 7.1 billion canadian dlrs.
chicago-based
  amoco had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion u.s. dlrs.
its amoco
  canada petroleum subsidiary is 100 pct owned by amoco corp.

budget chief miller warns fed on interest rates
  white house budget chief james
  miller said he was concerned that the federal reserve might
  "overreact" to the decline in the value of the u.s. dollar by
  raising interest rates, a move he said could cause a recession
  next year.
"our greatest danger is overreaction," miller told newspaper
  reporters yesterday.
"i'm concerned about the fed's
  overreaction.
i'm concerned about what i see in recent data
  showing a substantial fall in the money supply."
edwin dale, miller's spokesman, said the remarks, published
  in the new york times today, were accurate.
miller said he was concerned the fed might overreact to
  signals of rising inflation by tightening credit -- a move he
  said could have "political consequences."
the white house budget chief appeared to be referring to
  the effect an economic slowdown could have on the presidential
  and congressional elections next year.
"my fear is that if we get into a recession we are in deep
  soup, and there is no question about it," he said.
miller said an economic slowdown could lead to lower tax
  revenues and a widening of the budget deficit.
miller's remarks reflected concern that the u.s. central
  bank might feel compelled to tighten credit as a means of
  bolstering the dollar.
both treasury secretary james baker and federal reserve
  board chairman paul volcker recently have warned that further
  declines in the value of the u.s. dollar could jeopardize
  global growth prospects.
u.s. officials have urged japan and west germany to
  stimulate economic growth in their countries -- a move that
  could boost u.s. exports and relieve trade protectionist
  pressures in the united states.
bank of france sees pickup in industrial activity
  the bank of france said in its latest
  monthly report on the french economy it expected a pickup in
  industrial production registered in march to gather steam over
  the next few months.
without giving figures, the report said last month's rise,
  partly linked to efforts to catch up with production lost
  earlier this year through industrial action, was due mainly to
  a firming of domestic demand.
"new progress is expected in all main sectors except capital
  goods where production will remain at its present level," the
  report added.
the upbeat report comes in the wake of grim march trade
  balance figures which showed a deficit in industrial trade for
  the first time since june 1982.
while the automobile industry remained unchanged from
  previously boosted levels, consumer goods production grew and
  was expected to accelerate except in the area of domestic
  appliances.
semi-finished goods showed a clear increase in all
  sectors.
construction and civil engineering, boosted by a rise
  in public works, also improved, while retail trade sales in all
  sectors continued to slow.
italian wholesale prices up 0.2 pct in february
  italy's wholesale price index rose 0.2 pct
  month-on-month in february 1987 after increasing by 1.1 pct in
  january, the national statistics institute istat said.
the index, base 1980 equals 100, registered 173.1 in
  february compared with 172.8 in january.
the february figure represents a decline of 0.2 pct
  compared with february 1986 after a year-on-year decline in
  january 1987 of 1.7 pct.
yeutter says japanese curb all but certain
  u.s. trade representative clayton
  yeutter said it was all but certain president reagan would go
  ahead today and impose curbs on japanese exports as planned.
asked in a television interview what the chance was for
  reagan to cancel the scheduled 100 pct tariffs on japanese
  electronic exports, he said "slim to none."
reagan announced on march 27 he would impose the tariffs to
  retaliate for japan's failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end
  dumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less than
  cost and to open its home markets to u.s. products.
yeutter, on the nbc program "today," said the united states
  did not want to terminate the agreement and would drop
  the tariffs once japan began fulfilling the agreement.
he said japanese negotiators last week told u.s. officials
  they were honoring the pact, but yeutter said it would take
  time to monitor any compliance.
asked how long that would take, he said "we want to see a
  pattern of compliance, so in a minimum i would say that would
  take a few weeks."
yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumer
  impact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of japanese goods
  because the items selected are also readily available from
  other countries and manufacturers.
he said he did not think japan would retaliate.
"it seems to me it is not in the interests of either country
  to get in an escalating conflict.
the japanese understand that
  full well," yeutter said.
he added japan might challenge the tariffs in the general
  agreement on tariffs and trade (gatt), but "that's more of a
  paper kind of exercise and i don't really expect to see any
  adverse impact on u.s.
trade."
yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductor
  issue could be resolved before or during a washington visit
  later this month by japanese prime minister yasuhiro nakasone.
he said he hoped the visit, which is to have trade as a
  major issue, would be productive but "i don't see any practical
  way to resolve this particular dispute before or during his
  visit."

ford &lt;f> developing aluminum car frame
  ford motor co said it is developing an
  aluminum space frame for its probe v concept car using extruded
  stretch-formed aluminum that could lead to new techniques for
  building production cars in the future.
it said the frame would reduce vehicle weight and cost
  while maintaining structural integrity and crashworthiness.
the
  frame has fewer parts than conventional steel frames, ford
  said.
the company said the lighter weight would allow smaller
  powertrains and suspensions, further reducing weight and
  improving fuel economy.
ford said in addition, extrusion dies cost 1,000 to 12,000
  dlrs each, compared with hundreds of thousands of dollars for
  steel stamping dies, and using extruded aluminum the number of
  welds in a car could be reduced to about 40 from over 2,000.
u.s. commerce trade report omits freight costs
  the commerce department said on that
  insurance and freight costs for imported goods of 1.45 billion
  dlrs were included in the february trade deficit of 15.1
  billion dlrs reported on tuesday.
the department is required by law to wait 48 hours after
  the initial trade report to issue a second report on a "customs
  value" basis, which eliminates the freight and insurance
  charges from the cost of imports.
private-sector economists emphasized that the commerce
  department was not revising down the deficit by 1.45 billion
  dlrs but simply presenting the figures on a different basis.
a report in the washington post caused a stir in the
  foreign exchanges today because it gave the impression, dealers
  said, that the underlying trade deficit for february had been
  revised downward.
the commerce department would like to have the law changed
  to permit it to report both sets of figures simultaneously.
"my feeling is the second one is a better report but there's
  legislation that requires us to delay it two days," said robert
  ortner, commerce undersecretary for economic affairs.
"but this has been going on for a long time and no one pays
  any attention to the second figure."
the 15.1 billion dlr february trade deficit compared with a
  revised january deficit of 12.3 billion dlrs.
the law requiring a 48-hour delay in publishing the monthly
  trade figure excluding freight and insurance was passed in
  1979.
reportedly the feeling was the first figure, which includes
  customs, freight and insurance, allowed a better comparison
  with other countries that reported their trade balances on the
  same basis.
the second figure, which would always be lower by deducting
  freight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorable
  light for the reagan administration.
ortner said he would like to see the law changed to
  eliminate the 48-hour delay in reporting the two figures.
"we're considering it," he said, "it's one of those dinosaur
  laws and i think it's time has come."

fhlbb reports thrift results in fourth quarter
  the federal home loan bank board
  said its insured savings and loan associations (thrifts) that
  made a profit in the fourth quarter of 1986 reported moderate
  increases in net earnings.
it said that the 74 pct of the thrifts reporting profits

japanese tariffs seen as worldwide warning
  the tough trade sanctions president
  reagan imposed on japanese exports are not only a shot across
  japan's bow but also a sign reagan will attack unfair trade
  practices worldwide, u.s. officials said.
but robert crandall, a trade specialist at brookings
  institution, a think tank, said "a shot across their bow can
  often result in a shot in our stern."
he said it left the united states open to retaliation.
the u.s. officials said the 100 pct tariffs reagan ordered
  on 300 mln dlrs worth of japanese goods will also show congress
  that a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws,
  and no new protectionist legislation is needed.
in the past year tough trade action had been taken against
  the european community over corn and sorghum, taiwan over beer
  and wine, south korea over counterfeiting of copyrights,
  patents and trademarkets and japan on tobacco.
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters the
  tariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a "serious signal"
  to other nations on the need for fair trade practices.
reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers,
  television sets and some hand tools because japan did not honor
  an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at
  less than cost and to open its markets to u.s. products.
the
  tariffs were placed on items which were available from other
  sources so there would be little effect on the american
  consumer, fitzwater said.
reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action
  - especially against japan - to end global unfair trade
  practices and reverse the growing u.s. trade deficit.
the alternative was that if he did not, congress would.
the u.s. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billion
  dlrs, and continues to rise, with japan accounting for about
  one-third of america's overall deficit.
but there are other two-way deficits - with canada, west
  germany, taiwan and south korea - and reagan officials said the
  president is ready to fight them all.
reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that "i regret
  that these actions are necessary," but that the health and
  vitality of the u.s. semiconductor industry was essential to
  american competitiveness in world markets.
"we cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading
  practices," reagan added in the statement from his california
  vacation home at santa barbara.
he said the tariffs would remain in force until japan
  abided by the agreement.
u.s. officials say the action today will show congress -
  which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he
  already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade.
the white house aide said of the tariff action, "it wasn't
  done to appease congress, but because there was an unfair trade
  practice."
the aide added, however, "on another plane, it was an
  example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight
  unfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a major
  overall of our trade laws."
but the analyst, crandall, said the tariff action was not
  in the best interests of the united states, and that
  negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue.
"it's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route," he
  said, "because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in
  trade."
crandall said, "the administration is doing this for its
  political impact across the country, and therefore its impact
  on congress."
he said, "i don't think it makes a lot of sense."
but other analysts said it made little difference whether
  the tariffs were aimed at u.s. trading partners or congress,
  and that the main point was that the trading partners were on
  notice that retaliation was a weapon reagan was ready to use.
spokesman fitzwater said "we don't want a trade war," but the
  imposition of sanctions showed the united states would act when
  it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.

yeutter almost sure japan will not retaliate
  u.s. trade representative clayton
  yeutter said he was almost sure japan would not retaliate
  against tariffs president reagan slapped on 300 mln dlrs of
  japanese electronic goods today.
"i'd say it's 99 plus pct sure that it (the tariffs) will
  not provoke a retaliation on american products," yeutter told
  cable news network.
"japan has far too much at stake in this relationship (with
  the united states) to seriously entertain thoughts of
  retaliation," yeutter said.
earlier today, reagan 
  imposed 100 pct tariffs on a range of
  japanese goods in retaliation for japan's alleged violation of
  a bilateral pact governing semiconductor trade.
yeutter did say that u.s. farm products would be targeted
  if tokyo decided to hit back.
"if they (japan) were to retaliate, it would probably be on
  something like american agricultural products," he said.
"but i really think the chances of that happening are
  between slim and none," he added.
japan will not retaliate now against u.s. tariffs
  japan does not plan to take immediate
  retaliatory action against implementation of u.s. tariffs on
  some japanese electronic goods, the minister of international
  trade and industry, hajime tamura, said in a statement.
japan requested bilateral consultations in accordance with
  article 23-1 of the general agreement on tariffs and trade
  (gatt) in washington yesterday.
tamura said there was deep regret over the u.s.
measures,
  which will impose 100 pct tariffs on about 300 mln dlrs worth
  of japanese imports of some small computers, colour television
  sets and power tools.

fed data provide new evidence of tighter policy
  u.s. banking data released today are
  too distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary
  policy, but they do support the market's assumption that the
  federal reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit,
  economists said.
"it's clear that the fed has firmed somewhat.
discount
  window borrowings, net free reserves, the fed funds rate
  average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent
  with a modest tightening," said dana johnson of first chicago
  corp.
      johnson, and several other economists, now estimate that
  the fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct.
discount window borrowings in the week to wednesday were
  935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-week
  statement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week of
  december 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously.
moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billion
  dlrs from the fed on wednesday - the highest daily total this
  year - even though unexpectedly low treasury balances at the
  fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in
  reserves than the fed had anticipated.
however, economists said it is almost certain that the fed
  is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than
  witnessed this week.
they pointed to two factors that may have
  forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week.
first, economists now expect m-1 money supply for the week
  ended april 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs,
  partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the
  proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to
  pay annual income taxes.
as banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do the
  reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the fed.
required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billion
  dlrs a day in the two weeks ended wednesday, but economists
  said the fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the
  projected m-1 surge until late in the week and so started to
  add reserves too late.
second, an apparent shortage of treasury bills apparently
  left wall street dealers with too little collateral with which
  to enagage in repurchase agreements with the fed, economists
  said.
thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of repos
  outstanding on wednesday night, the fed may have wanted to add
  even more reserves but was prevented from doing so.
"it's not at all inconceivable that the fed didn't add as
  much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,"
  said ward mccarthy of merrill lynch economics inc.
      mccarthy estimated that the fed is now targetting
  discount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day,
  equivalent to a fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct.
after citing the reasons why the fed probably has not
  tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data,
  economists said the fact that the fed delayed arranging 
  overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the
  statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy.
jeffrey leeds of chemical bank had not been convinced that
  the fed was tightening policy.
but after reviewing today's
  figures, he said, "it's fair to say that the fed may be moving
  toward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture."
leeds expects fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8
  pct and said the fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate
  unless the dollar's fall gathers pace.
johnson at first chicago agreed, citing political
  opposition in washington to a dollar-defense package at a time
  when congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to
  reducing the u.s. trade surplus with japan.

mild coffee growers to meet in guatemala
  a large group of "other milds"
  coffee-growing nations will hold talks in guatemala next month
  to map their strategy for next september's meeting of the
  international coffee organisation (ico).
mario fernandez, executive director of the costa rican
  coffee institute, said delegates from mexico, the dominican
  republic, peru, ecuador, india, papua new guinea and five
  central american nations will participate in the two-day
  strategy session beginning may 4.
the main topic will be reform of what many producing
  countries perceive as the ico's unfair distribution of export
  quotas, fernandez said.
he said costa rica would press for quotas "based on the
  real production and export potential of each country in the
  past few years" and to distribute quotas based on "historic"
  production levels rather than recent harvests and crop
  estimates.
us study discusses dropped comsat-contel merger
  a congressional study today said the
  proposed, but now apparently abandoned, merger of the
  communications satellite corp &lt;cq> and contel corp &lt;ctc>
  would technically be legal but could violate the spirt of the
  law setting up comsat.
two weeks ago before the study was completed, contel
  announced it would seek to terminate the proposed merger.
the study by the non partisan congressional research
  service (crs) said "the proposed merger appears to comply,
  technically, with the mandates or letter of statutes, if may
  nevertheless violate the spirit of the law."
comsat, created by a 1962 act of congress, and contel, a
  corporation of local telephone and communications firms, filed
  with the federal communications commission last november 3 an
  application for merger.
several firms had protested the
  proposed merger.
in an analysis of the law, the research service issued
  several critical comments about the structure of the new firm
  and said apparent domination by contel of a restructured comsat
  would have broken the spirit of the law setting up
  comsat.comsat is the u.s. arm of intelstat, the international
  satellite communications firm.

bank of japan intervenes in tokyo market
  the bank of japan intervened just after
  the tokyo market opened to support the dollar from falling
  below 140.00 yen, dealers said.
the central bank bought a moderate amount of dollars to
  prevent its decline amid bearish sentiment for the u.s.
  currency, they said.
the dollar opened at a record tokyo low of 140.00 yen
  against 140.70/80 in new york and 141.15 at the close here
  yesterday.
the previous tokyo low was 140.55 yen set on april

australia's m-3 money supply rise 1.5 pct in march
  australia's m-3 money supply growth was
  1.5 pct in march and 11.3 pct in the 12 months to march, the
  reserve bank said.
this compared with a revised rise of 0.5 pct in february
  and 11.1 pct in the year to end-february.
the reserve bank said the m-3 data for march was affected
  by the start of the operations of &lt;national mutual royal
  savings bank ltd>, which has resulted in the transfer of
  deposits (equivalent to around 1.5 pct of m-3) from the united
  permanent building society to national mutual royal savings
  bank ltd.
the reserve bank said m-3 money supply in march was 110.77
  billion australian dlrs compared with a revised 109.11 billion
  in february and 99.48 billion in march, 1986.
m-3 is deposits of the private sector held by trading and
  savings banks plus holdings of notes and coins.

japan has no plans for new measures to aid dlr
  finance minister kiichi miyazawa said
  japan has no plans to take new emergency measures to support
  the dollar, other than foreign exchange intervention.
he also told reporters that many major nations yesterday
  intervened heavily to support the dollar against the yen.
yesterday's intervention was large in terms of the
  countries involved and the amounts expended, he said.
with the continued fall of the dollar against the yen,
  0speculation had arisen in currency markets here that japan
  might take new measures to support the u.s. currency, such as
  curbing capital outflows.
miyazawa said that yesterday's news of a 4.3 pct rise in
  u.s. gnp in the first quarter had been expected.
although the
  growth looks robust on the surface, the figures in reality are
  not that good, he said.
he said the ruling liberal democratic party (ldp) is
  expected to come up with a final set of recommendations of ways
  to stimulate the japanese economy before prime minister
  yasuhiro nakasone leaves for washington next week.
commenting on yesterday's report on economic restructuring
  by a high-level advisory panel to nakasone, miyazawa said it
  was important to put the panel's recommendations into effect.
standard oil says bp extends tender
  standard oil co &lt;srd> said in a brief
  announcement issued after a meeting of its board of directors
  that british petroleum co plc &lt;bp.l> (bp) has extended its 70
  dlr per share tender offer until midnight may 4.
the offer for the 45 pct of standard shares not owned by bp
  had been due to expire midnight april 28.
standard oil said discussions with bp concerning the tender
  were continuing but provided no further details.
"so long as those discussions continue, no recommendation
  will be made to standard oil shareholders regarding the offer,"
  standard said.
standard directors met at the company's cleveland
  headquarters on thursday in a regularly scheduled meeting.
the
  spokesman was unable to say if the meeting would continue on
  friday.
a committee of independent directors previously obtained an
  opinion from first boston corp that the standard shares were
  worth 85 dlrs each, 15 dlrs more than the bp offer.

ecuador to use colombia oil link for five years
  ecuador will use a new pipeline link
  with colombia to export crude oil for the next five years,
  colombian mines and energy minister guillermo perry said.
the link will be inaugurated on may 8.
it was built to
  allow ecuador to resume exports of crude oil halted on march 5
  by earthquake damage to its lago agrio to balao pipeline,
      once that pipeline is repaired, ecuador will exceed its
  opec quota in order to offset lost income and pay debts
  contracted with venezuela and nigeria since the quake, ecuador
  mines and energy minister javier espinosa said.
the two ministers were speaking at a news conference after
  signing an agreement for joint oil exploration and exploitation
  of the jungle border zone between the two nations.
drilling
  will begin in september.
"the agreement to transport ecuadorean crude oil is not only
  for this emergency period but for the next five years, with
  possibility of an extension.
between 20,000 and 50,000 barrels
  per day (bpd) will be pumped along it," perry said.
espinosa said ecuador planned to pump 35 mln barrels
  through the link in the next five years, at a cost of 75 cents
  per barrel during the first year.
the 43-km link, with a maximum capacity of 50,000 bpd, will
  run from lago agrio, the centre of of ecuador's jungle
  oilfields, to an existing colombian pipeline that runs to the
  pacific port of tumaco.
espinosa said the 32-km stretch of the link built on the
  ecuadorean side cost 10.5 mln dlrs.
perry gave no figures for
  colombia's 11 km segment but said it was "insignificant compared
  with what we are going to earn."
opec member ecuador was pumping around 250,000 bpd before
  the quake.
lost exports of 185,000 bpd are costing it 90 mln
  dlrs per month, espinosa said.

china province becomes grain importer
  the south china province of guangdong is
  importing millions of tonnes of grain a year from overseas and
  other parts of china because farmers have switched from grain
  to more profitable crops, the peking review magazine said.
the official magazine said the province's grain area fell
  to 4.33 mln hectares in 1985 from 5.7 mln in 1978 out of a
  total farmland area of 7.4 mln hectares.
farmers have switched to cash crops such as sugarcane,
  bananas, oranges, papaya and freshwater fish-farming, in part
  to supply major consumer markets in hong kong and macao, the
  magazine said.
it gave no 1986 area figures.
the magazine said china aims to keep 80 pct of national
  farmland under grain, 10 pct under cash crops and 10 pct under
  other crops, although the ratio will vary from place to place.
it said primitive cultivation methods, labour-intensity and
  low productivity make grain the least profitable farm
  commodity.
farmers in one central region of china can from 0.1
  hectare earn 2,250 yuan a year from vegetables, 375-450 yuan
  from cotton or 225 yuan from grain, it added.
it said consumer prices for foodgrain can be adjusted only
  gradually as part of a reform of the entire pricing system.

bundesbank reported to have no plan for rate cut
  bundesbank deputy president helmut

  reported.
the financial daily quoted schlesinger as saying in an
  interview that the bank would try to maintain current interest
  rate levels for the time being.
he also told the newspaper he saw no need for large-scale
  intervention in the foreign exchange market because exchange
  rates are stable.
earlier, schlesinger told a press conference that the
  bundesbank would continue its policy of maintaining short-term
  interest rates at a low level for currency stability.
he also said he was satisfied with the current dollar/mark
  exchange rate but added that he was not certain if it was ideal
  for the west german economy.
seoul announces more tariff cuts for u.s.
  south korea will cut import taxes on 50
  items, including construction equipment, photographic film,
  cigarettes and pipe tobacco, to help reduce its trade surplus
  with the united states, the finance ministry said.
the tariff cuts, of between five and 30 percentage points,
  take effect on july 1.
this brings to 157 the number of goods on which import
  taxes have been cut this year, a ministry official said.
the 157 are among about 290 items on which washington has
  asked seoul to lower tariffs, he added.
today's announcement follows saturday's removal of import
  curbs on 170 products.
for 46 of those products, the u.s. had
  had sought free access to the south korean market.
"this is in line with the government's policy to limit our
  trade surplus with the united states to help reduce trade
  friction between the two countries," the official said.
south korea's trade surplus with the u.s. rose to 7.3
  billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3 billion in 1985.
officials said
  the surplus was expected to widen further in 1987 but seoul
  would try to hold it below eight billion dlrs.
the finance ministry said tariffs would be cut later this
  month on a further 53 items, including acrylic yarn and
  ethylene, by an average 7.7 percentage points in order to check
  inflation.
the officials said the tariff cuts would contribute to
  holding wholesale and consumer price rises at less than three
  pct this year.
u.s. study says tariffs and quotas could backfire
  the use of tariffs and quotas to
  reduce the flow of foreign goods into the united states will do
  little to cut the nation's swelling trade deficit, a government
  study said.
in fact, the federal trade commission (ftc) report said,
  such protectionist policies could make u.s. products less
  competitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost of
  imported products that are re-exported in different forms.
"such policies are much more likely to hurt, rather than
  help, the productive capabilities of the u.s. economy," it said.
the 218-page report, written by ftc economists john hilke
  and philip nelson, blamed the rising trade shortfall, which
  climbed to a record 166.3 billion dlrs last year, on shifting
  currency exchange rates and growing u.s consumer demand.
other factors commonly blamed for the deficit, such as
  foreign trade practices, deteriorating u.s. industrial
  competitiveness, high labour costs and government restrictions
  on mergers, added little to the problem, it said.
"although each industry's competitiveness affects the level
  of imports and exports in that industry, in general we find
  that there have been no significant industry-specific changes
  affecting competitiveness that would explain the increase in
  the overall trade deficit," the study said.
"to the extent any government action is needed to deal with
  the trade deficits, policies should focus on economy-wide
  phenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth,"
  the ftc study said.
supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shifts
  were the cause of the increase in the trade deficit, the report
  said it found that nearly all u.s. industries lost some
  domestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s.
it also said it found a "fairly direct relationship" between
  the increased trade deficit and the influence of shifting
  currency exchange rates, u.s. economic growth and domestic
  demand for goods and services, which has outpaced foreign
  consumer demand.
the study examined seven factors which have been commonly
  blamed for the trade deficit: foreign government subsidies and
  trade barriers to protect foreign industries, a lack of
  investment in u.s. industry, declining research and development
  in u.s. industry, high labour costs, union work rules, the oil
  prices rises of the 1970s and u.s.
antitrust regulations.
in each case, the study found little or no evidence that
  the factor had any impact on the trade deficit.

renison gc and city resources set png gold venture
  renison goldfields consolidated ltd
  &lt;rgfj.s> (rgc) and explorer &lt;city resources ltd> have agreed in
  principle on a joint venture to re-examine the bulolo alluvial
  gold field in papua new guinea, city resources said.
city resources would progressively earn up to 66.66 pct of
  rgc's prospecting authority 585, which covers all the field, by
  spending a total of 6.5 mln kina, it said in a statement.
it said it believed bulolo was not fully exploited in the
  past, noting the literature refers to heavy gold losses in
  tailings during dredging from 1931 to 1967 which produced a
  total of 2.1 mln ounces.
city resources also said previous dredging was only carried
  out to a depth of 36 metres and high grade gold values are
  reported to at least 60 metres in the central part of the
  bulolo valley and possibly as deep as 90 metres.
in its productive life, recovered average grade at bulolo
  was 0.3 rpt 0.3 grams a tonne from some 207 mln cubic metres of
  gravel, it said.
city resources will act as operator.
the bulolo field, in morobe province, was the first
  successful gold mining operation of &lt;placer development ltd>
  after it was floated in canada in 1926.
it operated the field
  until dredging ceased in 1967.

window for bank aid in kuwait remains shut
  the kuwait central bank kept its window
  for funds to the domestic interbank deposit market shut as
  banks returned from a four day holiday, dealers said.
the move drove short-term interest rates sharply higher,
  with overnight and tomorrow-next funds more than doubling from
  last wednesday and hitting 20 pct.
there were few offers in a tight market and traders
  scrambled for any available funds.
one-month to one-year
  deposits were indicated one point higher at eight, seven pct
  but there was little activity at the longer end of the market.
bankers see the suspension of central bank aid as a
  deliberate move to drive up kuwaiti dinar interest rates and
  stem a flow of funds out of the country, where market
  nervousness is increasing over the growing tension in the gulf.
the central bank's move has been combined with a steady cut
  in the dinar exchange rate.
today's rate was reduced to 0.27939/73 to the dollar from
  0.27758/92 on wednesday before the four day bank holiday that
  celebrated the end of the fasting month of ramadan.

  bangladesh will import 60,000 tons of high
  speed diesel oil from the soviet union under a barter agreement
  signed here last week, bangladesh petroleum corporation
  officials said.
the oil worth about 10 mln u.s. dlrs will be shipped by
  december this year, they added but did not say what bangladesh
  would sell in return to the soviet union.
philippine coconut chief to lobby against ec tax
  philippine coconut authority (pca)
  chairman jose romero said he would visit brussels later this
  month to lobby against a proposed 100 pct european community
  (ec) levy on vegetable oil imports.
"i intend to visit brussels and talk to whoever is putting
  up this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countries
  like the philippines," romero said in an interview.
he said he did not know how much support the levy had
  within the ec but he said he believed those originally opposed
  to the tax were under pressure to change their position.
romero said a group of ec members led by west germany, the
  netherlands, denmark and norway were opposed to the tax.
but
  there was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change
  sides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.
romero said another threat to exports lay in an ec warning
  that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained
  dangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.
he said the ec standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin per
  million parts of meal, which ec countries had been asked to
  apply by october 1988, was too rigid.
he said philippine copra
  cake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.
aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it
  is not properly dried or ground.
romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in
  london that the philippines was doing its best to meet ec
  standards.
it was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally,
  but this was likely to take several years of research.
copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of total
  coconut exports in 1986.
the meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.
romero said he would also visit oxford university's
  department of agricultural economics to discuss ways of
  avoiding the copra process altogether.
"there are ways of producing coconut products outside of
  copra," romero said.
"we can process fresh coconut without drying
  the meat in the sun.
through the wet process we can process
  coconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go to
  the chemical root."
he said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to
  become more protectionist and he expected export prices of
  coconut products to drop.
"in the long term we will be getting less and less for more
  and more production, and i'm not comfortable with that," he
  said.
with countries like indonesia and malaysia stepping up
  production of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oil
  output had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, romero said.
"to add to that the u.s.
soybean association is spending
  billions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by
  saying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,"
  he said.
romero said he expected coconut product export prices to
  stay up for the rest of the year.
they would probably touch a
  high of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents,
  and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.
romero said the philippines was at the end of a five-year
  coconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall
  after two successive years of good harvests.
he said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, to
  add to the production fall, drought had affected output.
"traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the
  prices will start declining again.
the only sure way to keep
  prices stable is by processing, adding more value," he said.
coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by
  planting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.
"a typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on
  10,000 square metres of land.
that's a lot of space," romero
  said.
he said the government's proposed land reform program
  would exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because they
  had less than the proposed seven-hectares of land.
"if the idea of land reform is to increase income levels,
  production and employment then it won't happen," he said.
pca figures show about one-third of the country's
  population is dependent on the coconut industry.
coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares or
  one-fourth of total agricultural land.
pemex official says opec output critical to price
  crude oil prices could remain around 18
  dlrs a barrel until the end of the year, but opec's decision on
  output at its next meeting would be the critical factor, an
  official of mexico's state oil company, petroleos mexicanos
  (pemex), told a group of japanese businessmen.
adrian lajous, pemex' executive vice president of
  international trade, said current opec output already appeared
  to be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itself
  for the third quarter.
"production is surging ahead of what was
  originally planned, while demand is growing more slowly than
  envisaged a few months ago," he said.
he said opec had to look very carefully at what level of
  production in the third quarter would effectively sustain the
  18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally been
  envisaged might soften price levels.
the 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on june 25 in
  vienna to review its december accord on prices and output.
"i hope opec will follow a very conservative attitude in
  terms of volume decisions," lajous said.
a repetition of what happened last year, when opec boosted
  output and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, is
  always there as a possibility, he said.
"i hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986.
i
  expect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and
  discipline will be maintained," he said.
lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as
  this remains there will be a tendency to instability in oil
  markets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during
  1987 if output remains under control.
he said saudi king fahd's remarks last month, that
  increased production was not so important as long as incomes
  would not be affected by the output, were "very relevant and
  welcome from such a powerful producer."
coniston group to continue bid for allegis &lt;aeg>
  an investor group led by coniston
  partners said it plans to continue its effort to gain control
  of allegis corp despite the defensive maneuvers allegis
  announced last week.
allegis said then that it would borrow three billion dlrs
  and pay shareholders a dividend of 60 dlrs per share, lowering
  the company's net worth.
the coniston group, which owns 13 pct
  of allegis stock, has said that it would seek shareholder
  consents to remove 13 of the 16 allegis directors.
the group
  had said it would consider breaking up allegis into its
  airline, hotel and vehicle rental components if it succeeded.
the coniston group said it expects to make a further
  announcement today on its plans for allegis.
wall street analysts and traders had not expected coniston
  to abandon its pursuit of allegis as a result of the allegis
  defensive measures.
allegis officials were unavailable for comment.
cominco lead/zinc union rejects contract
  three united steelworkers
  of america locals on strike at cominco ltd rejected a tentative
  three-year contract, a union representative said.
"the vote was 1,229, or 54.5 pct, against, and 1,028, or
  45.5 pct, for the contract.
eighty-one pct of the membership
  voted," he said.
the union representative said that the pact offered cost of
  living increases designed to keep pace with inflation, but
  contained no wage increase.
the locals' bargaining committees are expected to meet and
  prepare for the reopening of negotiations with cominco, he
  said.
the three locals cover about 2,600 production and
  maintenance workers at cominco's trail smelter and kimberley,
  b.c.
lead-zinc mine.
output at both sites has been shut down since the
  production and maintenance workers, along with about 600 office
  and technical workers, went on strike may 9.
the two steelworkers locals representing the office and
  technical workers have not negotiated since may 21.
the strike caused cominco to declare force majeure, which
  means the company may not be able to honor contracts for
  products from the smelter and mine.
each of the five locals have separate contracts, all of
  which expired april 30, but the main issues are similar.
the union had requested a three pct wage increase in each
  year of a two-year contract.
cominco had pressed for a
  three-year contract and some loosening of the rules on job
  classifications.
the trail smelter, about 400 miles east of vancouver,
  produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons of
  lead last year.
the sullivan mine at kimberley, about 450 miles
  east of vancouver, produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year,
  most for processing at the trail smelter.
the smelter also produced cadmium, bismuth and indium.
revenues from the trail smelter totalled 356 mln canadian
  dlrs in 1986.

dutch cocoa processors unhappy with icco buffer
  dutch cocoa processors are unhappy with
  the intermittent buying activities of the international cocoa
  organization's buffer stock manager, industry sources told
  reuters.
"the way he is operating at the moment is doing almost
  nothing to support the market.
in fact he could be said to be
  actively depressing it," one company spokesman said.
including the 3,000 tonnes he acquired on friday, the total
  amount of cocoa bought by the buffer stock manager since he
  recently began support operations totals 21,000 tonnes.
despite this buying, the price of cocoa is well under the
  1,600 special drawing rights, sdrs, a tonne level below which
  the bsm is obliged to buy cocoa off the market.
"even before he started operations, traders estimated the
  manager would need to buy at least up to his 75,000 tonnes
  maximum before prices moved up to or above the 1,600 sdr level,
  and yet he appears reluctant to do so," one manufacturer said.
"we all hoped the manager would move into the market to buy
  up to 75,000 tonnes in a fairly short period, and then simply
  step back," he added.
"the way the manager is only nibbling at the edge of the
  market at the moment is actually depressing sentiment and the
  market because everyone is holding back from both buying and
  selling waiting to see what the manager will do next," one
  processor said.
"as long as his buying tactics remain the same the market is
  likely to stay in the doldrums, and i see no indication he is
  about to alter his methods," he added.
processors and chocolate manufacturers said consumer prices
  for cocoa products were unlikely to be affected by buffer stock
  buying for some time to come.

spectra-physics &lt;spy> board rejects tender offer
  spectra-physics inc said its
  board rejected a 32 dlrs per share unsolicited tender offer for
  the company's stock from ciba-geigy ltd &lt;cigz.z>, which already
  holds 18.8 pct of the stock.
spectra-physics said it also filed a lawsuit in delaware
  federal court this morning seeking to enjoin the offer and
  alleging, among other things, that the offer vilates federal
  securities laws, certain agreements between ciba-geigy and
  spectra-physics, and ciba-geigy's fiduciary duties.
spectra-physics said the two ciba-geigy designess to its
  board were not present at yesterday's special meeting which
  voted to reject the offer as financially inadequate, unfair and
  not in the best interests of spectra-physics or its
  stockholders.
the company said the board also authorized a special
  committee of outside directors to take whatever steps it deems
  necessary to protect the interests of spectra-physics and its
  stockholders and to investigate all alternatives to maximize
  the value of the stock, including talks with third parties.
spectra-physics said a letter communicating the board's
  recommendation and reasons therefore is being mailed to
  stockholders.
it said robert bruce, reliance group holdings inc's &lt;rel>
  designee on spectra-physics' board, resigned his position on
  may 29.
his letter of resignation said the action was to
  alleviate ciba-geigy's stated justification for making the
  unsolicited offer that it had not contemplated another
  significant investor having representation on the board when
  its spectra-physics' investment was made.
french say wheat stocks forecast no surprise
  the u.s. department of agriculture's
  forecast that french end-of-season soft wheat stocks will
  almost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not be
  surprising, according to french cereal organisation officials.
the cereals intervention board, onic, wheat producers'
  association and the national union of agricultural and cereal
  cooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports or
  end-of-season stocks.
however, the officials said the usda's figure of end
  1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mln
  was not surprising given a record high yield forecast in april.
the french feed cereals research institute, itcf, forecast
  in mid-april an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare for
  soft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 and
  the record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.
this would result in a french soft wheat harvest of around
  31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a ministry of
  agriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectares
  against 4.61 mln in 1986/87.
onic's first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaign
  will be released at the beginning of september, an onic
  official said.
soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult to
  estimate at this stage, both within the european community and
  to non-ec countries, an onic official said.
he said, however, that among countries to which france
  could increase its wheat exports were egypt and the maghreb
  countries (morocco, algeria and tunisia), he said.
the usda's forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in
  1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature,
  was not out of line with estimates of the french maize
  producers association, agpm, an agpm official said.
maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields were
  expected to be higher, the agpm official said.
it estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares,
  down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87.
boeing &lt;ba> to acquire defense electronics firm
  boeing co and argosystems inc &lt;argi.o>
  said they reached an agreement for boeing to acquire the
  sunnyvale, calif., defense electronics firm for about 275 mln
  dlrs.
the boards of both companies have approved the merger,
  which will be accomplished through a tender offer by a boeing
  subsidiary of 37 dlrs a share cash for all of argosystems'
  shares, the companies said.
under the agreement, the boeing subsidiary, tbc holdings
  corp, will begin the tender offer promptly.
if at least 90 pct
  of the shares are not tendered, the offer will be prorated to
  49 pct, the companies said.
argosystems has granted boeing an option to buy 1,238,311
  shares or 18.5 pct of the outstanding stock for 37 dlrs a
  share, they said.
also, bill may, chairman of argosystems, and three other
  officers have granted boeing an option to buy their shares,
  another 8.9 pct of the outstanding stock, for 37 dlrs a share.
argosystems makes equipment to monitor and analyze military
  communications signals, electronic warfare equipment to monitor
  and jam radar signals and signal processing systems.
for the nine months ended march 31, 1987, argosystems
  reported earnings more than doubled to 6.3 mln dlrs or 95 cts a
  share from 3.1 mln dlrs or 46 cts.
the year-ago period included
  a 2.2 mln dlr charge from a writedown of securities.
sales rose
  23.5 pct to 70.9 mln dlrs.
sales are expected to exceed 100 mln dlrs for the fiscal
  year ending june 30, the companies said in a joint statement.
the company's backlog is currently more than 180 mln dlrs,
  they said.
it has about 1,200 employees.
about 30 pct of argosystems' business comes from
  international customers.
"argosystems is a clear leader in its field.
this
  association will expand our overall activities and
  significantly enhance our ability to compete in the defense
  electronics area," boeing president frank shrontz said in a
  statement.
argosystems will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of
  boeing co.
the merger following the tender offer will be subject to
  approval by argosystems shareholders, the companies said.
the tender offer and merger are subject to customary
  conditions and expiration of the hart-scott-rodino notification
  waiting period, they said.
computer associates &lt;ca>, uccel set merger
  computer associates international inc
  and uccel corp &lt;uce> said they have signed a definitive merger
  agreement under which computer associates will pay about 800
  mln dlrs in stock for all outstanding uccel shares.
the companies said under the terms of the agreement, all
  uccel shareholders will receive about 1.69 shares of computer
  common stock for each of the approximately 17 mln uccel shares
  outstanding.
according to the companies, this would amount to about
  47.50 dlrs per uccel share, based on may 29 new york stock
  exchange closing prices.
closing of the transaction is anticipated in august, the
  companies said.
the companies said the resulting company wil
  retain the name computer associates international inc.
      additionally, the companies said charles wang, currently
  computer associates chairman and chief executive, will continue
  as chairman of the new company.
zambia cuts prices as troops patrol copperbelt
  the zambian government today announced
  minor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its new
  economic strategy, while police and troops patrolled the
  northern copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting.
however, staple foods, such as bread, sugar and maize meal,
  were not affected by the cuts and many people said this could
  provoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected more
  sweeping reductions.
observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with the
  small extent of the price cuts, which ranged up to 10 pct on
  items such as blankets, soap, detergents and baby food.
residents in the copperbelt contacted by telephone said
  government forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns.
in lusaka, business went on as usual and there was no sign
  of troops or police reinforcements on the streets.
president kaunda had ordered the price reductions to take
  account of lower import costs following the revaluation of the
  kwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on may 1.
the revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economic
  strategy which kaunda adopted to replace zambia's imf austerity
  program.
labour leaders in the copperbelt said last week gangs of
  unemployed youths were being formed in the politically volatile
  region to take action against shops that did not reduce their
  prices after today's deadline.
fifteen people were killed in
  the copperbelt during food riots last december after the
  government tried to lift maize subsidies.
seoul announces more tariff cuts for u.s.
  south korea will cut import taxes on 50
  goods, including construction equipment, cigarettes and
  tobacco, to help reduce its trade surplus with the united
  states, the finance ministry said today.
the tariff cuts of
  between five and 30 pct will take effect on july 1.
south korea ran a trade surplus of 7.3 billion dlrs with
  washington in 1986, sharply up from 4.3 billion in 1985.
today's announcement brings to 157 the number of goods for
  which similar measures were taken this year, a ministry
  official said.
the 157 are among about 290 items on which
  washington has asked seoul to lower tariffs.
"this is in line with the government's policy to limit our
  trade surplus with the united states to help reduce trade
  friction between the two countries," said the official.
entertainment makes buyout offer to crazy eddie
  entertainment marketing inc &lt;em>
  said it has made an offer to the board of crazy eddie inc to
  acquire all outstanding shares of crazy eddie inc for eight
  dlrs a share in cash.
entertainment said the offer would be conducted through a
  negotiated merger with a new corporation to be formed by
  entertainment marketing.
entertaiment said it has requested an early meeting with
  crazy eddie inc's board and that it has committed 50 mln dlrs
  toward the purchase of the shares including those already
  purchased.
the company also said it has retained dean witter reynolds
  inc to assist in raising the balance of the financing.
according to entertainment, its company and its chairman
  own about 4.3 pct of crazy eddie's currently outstanding
  shares.
additionally, the company said it is willing to negotiate
  all aspects of its offer and is willing to consider a
  transaction which would be tax free to crazy eddie's
  shareholders.
india plans more bombay offshore oil wells
  india's state-owned oil and natural gas
  commission (ongc) plans to drill more wells in the bombay
  offshore area, where a well spudded in february this year gave
  both oil and gas, an ongc spokesman said.
the exploratory well, spudded at a depth of 2,140 metres,
  yielded 2,000 barrels of oil and 180,000 cubic metres of gas
  per day, he said.
"the well, one of the four structures drilled in the area 80
  km north-west of bombay, indicates good prospects of both oil
  and gas.
we've decided to drill at least three more wells in
  there before starting production on a commercial scale."
production of bombay high, part of the bombay offshore
  field, has stabilised at around 500,000 barrels per day for the
  last two years.
ongc produced 27.85 mln tonnes of crude in 1986/87 ending
  march, up from 27.51 the previous year.
bombay high accounted
  for 20.61 mln tonnes, marginally up from 20.10 the year before.
india's total oil output is around 30 mln tonnes.
ongc has been exploring the bombay offshore area, developed
  since the late 1970s, for more oil as production from bombay
  high has reached a plateau.

saudi renegotiation of aramco deal moving along
  saudi arabia's renegotiation of its
  collective agreement with aramco to purchase oil for the
  latter's ex-partners is moving along and should lead to a
  fundamental structural change in the contract, oil industry
  sources said.
petroleum intelligence weekly, in this monday's edition,
  said negotiations are moving along for adjustment of the 1.34
  mln bpd joint long term agreement at official prices and
  volumes and other terms may be rearranged.
the agreement signed in january for the months from
  february to june is up for renegotiation.
under the january contract aramco was to purchase 1.34 mln
  bpd for the four partners allocated among them as exxon corp
  &lt;xon> 440,000 bpd, texaco inc &lt;tx> 350,000 bpd, mobil corp
  &lt;mob> and chevron corp &lt;chv> 550,000 bpd between them.
but an overlifting by texaco inc in the first quarter
  allowed other companies like exxon corp to underlift its
  obligations under the contract
      piw said that that one alternative under consideration is
  to revert to four individual contracts rather than a collective
  agrement.
john lichtblau, director of the petroleum industry research
  foundation inc said that renegotiation of the pact was more of
  a formality as the saudis have each company on a separate
  schedule although separate agreements with the companies would
  favor one on one negotiations and ensure that contracted
  liftings occur .
"the companies will probably follow the saudi wants within
  limits as they do not want to antagonize them for the long
  haul," he said.
lichtblau said that the renegotiations would most likely
  concentrate on volume rather than price.
saudi displeasure with the agreement has long been noted
  and in april industry publications said that renegotiation were
  being sought, a fact later confirmed by reuters with aramco.
aramco corp was formerly owned by chevron corp &lt;chv>, exxon
  corp &lt;xon>, mobil corp &lt;mob> and texaco inc &lt;tx> but is now
  owned by saudi arabia which bought its assets although the
  ex-partners have various agreements with saudi arabia.
oklahoma cleaning up after week of floods, rains
  residents of central oklahoma
  returned to their homes over the weekend after a week of heavy
  rains and severe flooding that left two dead and caused more
  than 20 mln dlrs in damage, officials said.
some 900 people were evacuated from their homes during the
  rains and flooding last week, civil defense officials said.
many of the shelters set up throughout the state in areas
  threatened by flooding, except those near the washita and red
  rivers, closed as residents returned to their damaged homes.
farmers who had expected a near-record wheat crop now say
  this year will see one of the largest losses in decades.

brazil not selling to cocoa buffer stock - trade
  brazil is not selling cocoa beans
  to the international cocoa organization, icco, buffer stock, as
  spot prices for beans in the interior area are 20 to 25 pct
  higher than levels which would be paid by the icco buffer stock
  manager, trade sources in the major producing state bahia said.
the scarcity of beans because of the effects of drought on
  the current temporao harvest has pushed prices well above
  international levels, the sources noted.
the only buyers are bean exporters or local processors
  covering previously contracted commitments, they added.
if sales were made they would be executed by individual
  exporting companies which are members of the brazilian cocoa
  trade commission, they said.

pay n' pak &lt;pnp> gets two offers for company
  pay n' pak stores inc said it received
  two proposals in response to its previously announced
  solicitation of potential buyers for the company.
the company said it is evaluating the proposals from paul
  bilzerian and from a third party which is active in the
  leveraged buyout field but which pay n' pak declined to
  identify.
it said the bilzerian proposal calls for shareholders to
  receive on a blended basis 16.67 dlrs in cash and 3.30 dlrs in
  liquidation value of cumulative exchangeable redeemable
  preferred stock for each common share.
pay n' pak said the second proposal is structured as a
  merger in which each holder would receive a combination of
  17.50 dlrs in cash and 2.50 dlrs in liquidation value of 13-1/2
  pct cumulative preferred.
the company said the dividend on the preferred offered by
  bilzerian would be set so that in the opinion his financial
  advisor and the company's financial advisor the preferred would
  trade in the public market at its liquidation value.
dividends on the preferred could be paid at the option of
  the surviving corporation in cash or additional shares of
  preferred for the first five years, it added..
     
      pay n' pak said bilzerian's proposal is subject to a
  physical inventory of merchandise at june 30.
bilzerian did not
  provide details with respect to financing of his proposal,
  which is not subject to a financing condition.
the company said dividends on the preferred being offered
  in the second proposal would be paid in additional preferred in
  the first three years and the preferred would be redeemed in
  years 12 and 13.
it said the second offer is contingent on the arrangement
  of financing, adding the party making the offer is confident of
  its ability to obtain the balance of the financing.
pay n' pak said the second proposal is conditioned upon a
  satisfactory agreement with the company's management regarding
  its equity participation in the new company.
the second party anticipates executing a letter of intent
  when it delivers its financing commitment to the pay n' pak
  board that would incorporate an expense reinbursement and
  option arrangement, the company said.
maxwell files suit to stop harcourt &lt;hbj>
  publisher robert maxwell's british
  printing and communicaton corp plc said it filed a lawsuit in
  u.s. district court against harcourt brace jovanovich inc, its
  directors and advisers to stop, among other things, payment of
  the special dividend harcourt is paying as part of its
  recapitalization.
the suit, filed in manhattan, also names first boston corp
  &lt;fbc> and seeks to void the issue by harcourt of 40,000 shares
  of super voting preferred stock to first boston securities corp
  and the issue of convertible voting preferred stock with
  4,700,000 votes in the harcourt employee stock ownership plan.
the preferred shares to be issued to first boston have
  8,160,000 votes.
the suit, brought derivatively on behalf of
  harcourt and individually in british printing's capacity as a
  substantial holder of harcourt common shares and 6-3/8 pct
  convertible debentures.
the suit alleges harcourt's special dividend exceeds by
  more than one billion dlrs harcout's surplus available for
  dividends under new york law and contstitutes a fraudulent
  conveyance.
the lawsuit also alleges that harcourt failed to disclose
  that one consequence of the payment of the dividend, which it
  terms illegal, will be that shareholders will be liable to
  repay it.
harcourt last week said it would pay 40 dlrs per share to
  stockholders as a special dividend.
harcourt also announced an
  extensive recapitalization plan, which analysts said was aimed
  at thwarting a takeover effort by british printing.
british printing last week withdrew its 44 dlr per share,
  or two billion dlr offer for harcourt because of the
  recapitalizaton plan.
at the time, it said it was reviewing its
  alternatives.
british printing said it filed the suit after consultation
  with its advisers.
its lawsuit also alleges that harcourt
  failed to disclose the effect of the special dividend on
  harcourt 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures.
british printing alleges the effect will be an enormous
  increase effective on the june eight record date for the
  dividend in the number of harcourt common shares issuable upon
  conversion of the debentures.
british printing also charged 
  harcourt is unlawfully coercing debenture holders to convert
  denbentures before the record date because harcourt may not
  have enough authorized common shares to honor conversion after
  the date.
british printing holds 460,600 shares and 5.6 mln dlrs
  worth of debentures.
the suit also alleges that management, the board of
  directors, and first boston engaged in an illegal scheme of
  entrenchment through a combination of selling to first boston
  securities corp the super voting preferred at a bargain price,
  the grant to the company employee stock plan of convertible
  voting preferred, the six mln share open market repurchase
  program and the manner in which its financing has been
  structured.

it said the sale of polyco of cincinnati, ohio, which makes
  polyvinyl acetate emulsions, to rohm and haas co &lt;roh> was

u.k. bankers consider new ecgd financing plan
  representatives of major u.k. based banks
  are meeting here today to consider a new plan for reducing the
  cost of financing british exports guaranteed by the export
  credits guarantee department (ecgd), senior banking sources
  said.
the plan is being developed in conjunction with the ecgd
  and the bank of england.
neither the ecgd nor the bank of england would comment on
  the plan.
however, bankers said one of the main points under
  discussion is a plan to refinance the bulk of the ecgd's medium
  term credit portfolio in the international capital markets.
the proposals involve introducing a set of interest margins
  on ecgd backed debt of 5/16 to 7/8 pct, depending on the size
  and maturity of the credit and the currency.
the banks are likely to push for a higher margin.
bankers
  said that while these rates would reduce a bank's return they
  would still be more than those proposed about a year ago when
  the government attempted unsuccessfully to initiate another
  cost reduction plan.
at the same time, the banks would be expected to allow the
  ecgd to realise additional savings by refinancing existing
  government backed credit in the capital markets.
on credits that are refinanced an original lender would
  receive a residual margin of 7/16 pct for loans up to 10 mln
  stg and 3/16 pct on larger transactions.

  for coca-cola to buy 1,600,000 coke consolidated common shares
  and operating cash flow should allow it to reduce its long-term

the acquisition is being evaluated by geodyne board members
  not employed by the company, painewebber or any company

geodyne resources said a registration related to the stock

compromise seen likely over conoco-statoil dispute
  norway is expected to seek a compromise
  solution to defuse a row between den norske stats oljeselskap
  a/s &lt;stat.ol> (statoil) and conoco norge a/s over which firm
  will operate the heidrun oil field, government sources said.
the sources, who asked not to be named, said the government
  will likely recommend that conoco be allowed to continue as the
  field's operator through the development phase, with statoil
  taking over only after production starts in the early 1990s.
oil minister arne oeien told reuters the government had
  today discused the heidrun matter but that no final decision
  had been taken and several questions remained unresolved.
it was unlikely the government would announce its decision
  on heidrun operatorship until after thursday's cabinet meeting
  and after discussing a proposed solution with both companies,
  the sources added.
this spring norway's state-owned oil company statoil
  exercised an option in the heidrun field exploration license
  that, if approved by the government, would allow it to relieve
  conoco as heidrun operator, a move sharply criticised by
  conoco.
heidrun is often cited by the government and industry as
  the most likely candidate for the first field development
  project on the haltenbanken exploration tract off central
  norway.

dutch official rate cut seen still likely
  a cut of about half a percentage point
  in dutch official interest rates is still in prospect, although
  economists said the timing would depend on bundesbank moves.
speculation has been rife that the dutch central bank,
  encouraged by a strong guilder/mark relationship and wide
  premiums for dutch money and capital market rates over german,
  might lower rates without the bundesbank moving first.
last month, the central bank lowered its special advances
  rate to 5.1 pct from 5.25 pct after the bundesbank dropped its
  repurchase tender rate to 3.55 pct from 3.8 pct.
that rate has remained in force, just holding above the
  five pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial
  bank borrowings.
given a strong guilder, a further fall in the west german
  repo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff,
  forcing an official dutch rate cut, analysts said.
in february, when the bundesbank cut its discount rate to
  three pct from 3.5 pct, the central bank only lowered money
  market rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loans
  rate on lending under its three month credit quota.
since then, however, both the central bank and finance
  ministry have made it clear they favour lower official rates.
in april, central bank president wim duisenberg said he
  would follow any bundesbank cut, and last week the finance
  ministry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2.25 billion
  guilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100.10 pct
  for an effective yield of 5.98 pct, the lowest since 1965.
technically, analysts said, there has to be a difference
  between the secured loans rate which applies to lending under
  the credit quota, and the tariff on special advances which add
  extra liquidity to the money market.
bank economists and dealers said a west german move to
  further lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would
  result in the central bank easing the special advance rate,
  provided the guilder/mark relationship permitted.
the central bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its
  parity value within the european monetary system of 112.673
  guilders per 100 marks.
today, foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10
  guilder cents to 112.705 guilders per 100 at the fix, a level
  that would not permit a change in the interest rate
  differential between west germany and the netherlands, dealers
  said.
an economist at abn bank said he expected west german and
  dutch interest rates to ease in the short term.
however, he
  said new wage agreements in west germany had raised inflation
  expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates
  in the longer term.
in the netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil,
  or even negative, while the latest official economic forecasts
  point to a falling rate of economic growth.
"it will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement
  negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,"
  the abn economist said.
he said dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct in
  january, could also contribute to some inflation.
at amro bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run to
  two pct next year.
the bank expects dutch capital market rates,
  currently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in the
  second half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct.
analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying
  spree on the bond market which would bring yields down,
  probably only temporarily, while money rates could fall below
  five pct.
currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct in
  the money market.

little reaction to comex price limit removal
  the elimination of price limits on
  precious metals contracts trading at the commodity exchange in
  new york appears to be having little effect on the market,
  analysts said.
"there is nothing apparent from the change," said william
  o'neill, director of futures research at elders futures inc.
  "the market has not approached the old price limits and trading
  is relative quiet, in narrow ranges," he added.
gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs on
  market moves in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker
  in the nearby contracts amid thin conditions, traders said.
on may 5, comex did away with price limits on the two
  contracts following spot after a volatile market in silver
  futures at the end of april caused severe disruptions.
during the last week of april, silver futures traded up and
  down the price limit in the back months, causing traders to
  rush into the spot contract to offset those moves, analysts
  said.
as a result, elders' o'neill said, there was much
  confusion, many unmatched trades, and large losses.
the comex fined elders futures and three other large firms
  a total of 100,000 dlrs for failure to resolve unmatched trades
  in a timely manner.
silver futures were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the
  nearby contracts amid quiet trading today.
o'neill said the elimination of price limits on all comex
  metals futures would add caution to trading since all contracts
  could move any distance.
"this is amore realistic approach because the metals market
  is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,"
  o'neill said.
paul cain, a vice president at shearson lehman brothers,
  said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic
  buying or selling  and contribute to more orderly markets.

u.s. trade bill very dangerous for canada, lobby
  a trade bill before the united states
  house of representatives "is a very dangerous bill for canadian
  industry," canadian forest industry council chairman adam
  zimmerman told reporters.
by changing the definition of subsidy under u.s.
  countervailing duty law, house of representatives bill 3
  removes protection for companies that take advantage of widely
  used government programs, zimmerman told a media briefing.
"clearly, any industry to which canadian governments grant
  rights to fish, mine, cut timber, or produce power could be
  vulnerable to a finding of a subsidy under this language," he
  said.
the canadian forest lobby's zimmerman also said the house
  of representative bill would adopt a new way of measuring
  subsidies that would greatly increase the size of any
  countervailing duties that might be imposed on canadian
  resource exports to the u.s.
under the bill, any difference between canadian prices and
  u.s. or world market prices would constitute a subsidy, he
  said.
such a method would make canadian resource industries
  vulnerable to similar penalties like a 15 pct export tax
  imposed last january on shipments of canadian softwood lumber
  to the u.s., zimmerman added.
canadian negotiators agreed to levy the new tax if a u.s.
  forest industry lobby would drop its request for a countervail
  duty on imports of canadian softwood lumber.
"we represent the first victim of the move to price other
  countries' natural resources according to the u.s. system,"
  zimmerman said.
"if we're an example, than other resource industries had
  better watch out," he added.
zimmerman said the canadian forest industry council plans
  to discuss concerns about the u.s. trade bill with lobby groups
  from other canadian resource industries.

ec ministers consider cutbacks in steel support
  a new steel quota system that would
  strictly limit european community (ec) support to the industry
  could be forced on producers if they fail to find their own
  solution quickly, officials said.
ec industry ministers meeting here considered two key
  proposals aimed at cutting back surplus capacity by 30 mln
  tonnes by 1990.
the first would limit the current quota system, which has
  protected ec output for seven years, only to flat products and
  heavy sections, thereby forcing other types of steel products
  into free market competition.
the second proposal would link continuation of a quota
  system with progress toward plant closures, although less than
  a month ago the ec steelmakers' lobby group eurofer said they
  had abandoned efforts to close plants voluntarily.
the ministers stopped short of imposing their own solution
  immediately, instead urging steel producers to try again to
  reach agreement on voluntary cutbacks.
the ec commission has said it will come up with detailed
  proposals in july on the future of the ec steel industry and ec
  industry ministers meet again in september to reach a final
  decision.

peerless earned 576,000 dlrs or 63 cts per share in fiscal
  1986.
it said the units being sold lost 28 cts per share in the

canada lumber exports may become unprofitable
  canada's softwood lumber will become
  unprofitable for some forest product producers if prices
  decline to about 175 u.s. dlrs per thousand board feet of two
  by four inch lumber from current levels of about 195 u.s. dlrs,
  canadian forest industry council chairman adam zimmerman told
  reporters.
zimmerman reiterated profitability has been hurt by a move
  by canadian negotiators to impose last january a 15 pct export
  tax on softwood lumber shipped to the u.s. in exchange for a
  u.s. lumbermen's lobby dropping its request for a countervail
  duty.
"i think that there has been a falling off in the market, so
  i think there is a moderate slow down in the price now,"
  zimmerman said at a media briefing.
zimmerman said the adverse impact from lower u.s. lumber
  product prices would be felt by lumber mills in eastern canada
  first, migrating westward.
"the country has swallowed a time bomb and it will go off
  when times get tough," zimmerman said.
he also said the federal government should maintain the
  existing 15 pct export tax and not allow provinces to offset
  the tax with increased provincial fees for cutting lumber.

computer assoc.
&lt;ca> bolsters hand against ibm
  computer associates international inc's
  800 mln dlr merger with uccel corp &lt;uce> will eliminate its
  strongest rival, but the company still faces stiff competition
  from international business machines corp &lt;ibm>, wall street
  analysts said.
"ibm is still the ruling force in mainframe systems
  software," said scott smith, an analyst with donaldson lufkin
  and jenrette.
"but the combination of the two companies will clearly
  present a much stronger front," he said.
besides ibm, "computer associates will be far and away the
  most powerful company in the field," added e.f. hutton analyst
  terence quinn.
that field is a segment of the market known as system
  utilities, or software packages that boost the productivity of
  a company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed,
  power and efficiency of large mainframe computers.
the merger of uccel and computer associates combines the
  two biggest systems utilities suppliers other than ibm.
analysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms that
  will find the competition much harder than in the past.
for computer associates, the merger with uccel caps a
  six-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the garden city,
  n.y.-based company to the top of the software industry.
when the deal is completed sometime in august, the
  company's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past 
  microsoft corp &lt;mfst> as the world's largest independent
  software vendor.
computer associates founder and chairman charles b. wang
  took the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought
  15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3
  mln dlrs for the year ended march 31.
liemandt took charge of wyly, sold off its non-computer
  businesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframe
  computer software.
in 1984, the company was renamed uccel corp.
      liemandt, who said he will leave the company after the
  merger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth.
on the last day of 1986, uccel completed the buyouts of six
  companies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs.
for 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, on
  sales of 141.5 mln dlrs.
the agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largely
  because the companies had been such bitter rivals.
also,
  dallas-based uccel had engineered a strong comeback from the
  dark days of 1982, when, as wyly corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or
  56 cts a share.
at that time, wyly owned a potpourri of 13 different
  businesses, only three of which were involved in computer
  software.
in 1983, walter haefner, a swiss financier and a
  major wyly investor, lured gregory j. liemandt away from his
  job as chairman of general electric co's &lt;ge> computer services
  unit.
computer associates' wang and uccel's liemandt said at a
  news conference that the merger would give computer users a
  single source for a wide range of software products.
in addition to system utilities, computer associates also
  sell products for microcomputers, while uccel has made inroads
  in the applications software market, where analysts said it has
  been successful with accounting and banking systems.
wang said computer associates would continue to support and
  enhance both companies' product lines, but noted that the
  company will eventually weed out duplicate offerings.
he said
  about 20 pct of the companies' products overlap.
analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings of
  current computer associates shareholders by about 10 pct.
but
  they joined wang in forecasting that the deal will not dilute
  computer associates' earnings for the current fiscal year.
quinn of e.f. hutton said wang has a proven track record of
  completing acquisitions without earnings dilution.
therefore,
  he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05
  dlrs a share.
wang said he would look closely at the combined operations
  of the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketing
  and research and development.
analysts said computer associates paid a premium for uccel.
based on friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50
  dlrs worth of its stock for each uccel share, which is nearly
  33 times uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share.
stephen t. mcclellan of merrill lynch research said most
  software companies are currently valued at about 20 times
  per-share earnings.
but the analyst said uccel was worth the
  premium because of its earnings potential and customer base.
wang said haefner, the swiss investor, would hold about 25
  pct of computer associates stock after the merger.
he currently
  owns 58 pct of uccel.
the executive said the merger would not alter his target of
  maintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct.
in addition, he said he expects no problems in having the
  deal cleared by the antitrust division of the u.s. justice
  department.
uccel's liemandt declined to say what he will do after the
  merger, but he did not rule out working together with wang.
maxwell would not renew bid if suit fails
  british press magnate robert maxwell said
  his british printing and communication corp plc would not renew
  its bid for harcourt brace jovanovich inc &lt;hbj> if the lawsuit

speaking at a press conference, maxwell denied market
  rumors that british printing had approached british

"i don't believe in chasing mirages," maxwell said.
british printing filed suit in u.s. district court in
  manhattan to block what maxwell called a fraudulent
  recapitalization announced by harcourt last week.
harcourt, in response to a hostile two billion dlr takeover
  proposal from maxwell, planned a recapitalization that would
  pay shareholders 40 dlrs per share.
under the plan, it also
  said 40 pct of its shares will be controlled by its employees,
  management, and its financial adviser, first boston corp &lt;fbc>.

cocoa origins dismayed by buffer stock action
  traders recently returned from west africa
  say some producers there are dismayed by the ineffective action
  so far by the international cocoa organization (icco) buffer
  stock manager on buffer stock purchases.
one trader said some west african producers are annoyed the
  buffer stock manager is not playing his part as required by the
  international cocoa pact to stabilise prices from current lows.
so far, only 21,000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have been
  taken up for buffer stock purposes and this, traders noted,
  only on an intermittent basis.
they noted the purchases, of 8,000 tonnes in the first week
  he bought and 13,000 in the second, are well short of the
  limitations of no more than 5,000 tonnes in one day and 20,000
  in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him.
the traders recently returned from west africa say
  producers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices so
  far, noting producing countries are part of the international
  cocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers.
london traders say terminal market prices would have to
  gain around 300 stg a tonne to take the icco 10-day average
  indicator to its 1,935 sdr per tonne midway point (or reference
  price).
however, little progress has been made in that direction,
  and the 10-day average is still well below the 1,600 sdr lower
  intervention level at 1,562.87 from 1,569.46 previously.
the buffer stock manager may announce today he will be
  making purchases tomorrow, although under the rules of the
  agreement such action is not automatic, traders said.
complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock manager
  are not confined to west african producers, they observed.
a reuter report from rotterdam quoted industry sources
  there saying dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with the
  intermittent buffer stock buying activities.
in london, traders expressed surprise that no more than
  21,000 tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against total
  potential purchases under the new agreement of 150,000 tonnes.
carryover holdings from the previous international cocoa
  agreement in the stock total 100,000 tonnes.
terminal prices today rose by up to 10 stg a tonne from
  friday's close, basis july at its high of 1,271.
it seems that when the buffer stock manager is absent from
  the market, prices go up, while when he declares his intention
  to buy, quite often the reverse applies, traders said.

little reaction to removal comex daily limits
  the elimination of limits on daily price
  fluctuations for metals futures contracts traded on the
  commodity exchange, comex, appears to be having little effect
  on the market, analysts said.
"there is nothing apparent from the change," said william
  o'neill, director of futures research at elders futures inc.
      "the market has not approached the old price limits and
  trading is relative quiet, in narrow ranges," he said.
on may 5, comex eliminated price limits on the two
  contracts following each spot delivery in gold, silver, copper
  and aluminum futures after a review of its clearing operations,
  which were severely tested by a volatile market in silver
  futures at the end of april.
comex announced friday the lifting
  of all daily limits, effective today.
gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs per
  ounce in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker in the
  nearby contracts amid thin volume conditions, traders said.
silver futures, previously limited at 50 cents in most back
  months, were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearby
  contracts amid quiet trading today.
during the last week of april, silver futures often traded
  at the daily allowable limit amid concerns about inflation, the
  dollar, and other factors.
traders rushed into the spot, or
  unlimited, contract to offset those moves, analysts said.
as a result, o'neill said, there was much confusion, many
  unmatched trades, and large losses for some traders.
the comex fined four large firms a total of 100,000 dlrs
  for failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner.
paul cain, a vice president at shearson lehman brothers,
  said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic
  buying or selling and contribute to more orderly markets.
o'neill added that the elimination of daily limits would
  add caution to trading.
"this is a more realistic approach because the metals
  market is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,"
  o'neill said.
total health &lt;tlht.o> to make acquisition

  financing.
the company said the acquisition is subject to regulatory

tin traders' response muted to kl futures market
  european free market tin traders made a
  somewhat muted response to plans for a kuala lumpur
  dollar-based tin futures market due to be launched in october.
traders said the new market would probably be a useful
  trading medium for japan and other south east asian tin
  interests although european traders generally appear to be
  reasonably satisfied with the current "free market" system
  which has been operating since london metal exchange, lme, tin
  trading ceased in october 1985.
dealers here will also want to
  see how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market and
  what sort of demand develops for forward deliveries.
there is also a view among european traders that, while the
  proposed kuala lumpur tin futures market would provide another
  useful reference point, a market inaugurated by the malaysian
  government -- in the past viewed as a major player at times by
  the trade -- would make participants uncomfortable.
some traders expressed a preference for a resumption of
  trading on the london metal exchange, but they added that while
  there has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subject
  a definite move is unlikely until outstanding high court
  litigation actions have been resolved.
spot tin prices on the european free market are currently
  around 4,200 stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouse
  rotterdam.
over the past 18 months the price moved to a ten
  year low of 3,400 stg in march 1986 and rebounded to as high as
  4,680 stg in december 1986.
this compares with 8,140 stg last paid when lme trading
  ceased in october 1985 and a record high tin price of 10,350
  stg traded for cash standard grade metal in june of that year.
lme warehouse stocks are now near a two-year low at 28,065
  tonnes, having fallen steadily from a record high of 72,485
  tonnes reached in february 1986.
traders said the free market turned bullish during late
  last year based on producer forecasts of a supply/demand
  deficit of some 28,000/29,000 tonnes.
analysts were predicting
  prices of up to 5,000 stg per tonne during 1987.
however, the trend was reversed following a strong upswing
  in sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to
  4,100 stg last month after approaching 4,700 stg in december.
the decline accelerated as producers who had sold very
  little metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers.
there was also a lack of significant demand from major
  steel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year.
traders say the 15 itc creditor banks' original tin
  holdings of nearly 45,000 tonnes have now been almost halved,
  and the bulk of material still available is being held by
  malaysian and japanese firms which are reluctant to depress the
  market with unwanted metal.
some 80,000 tonnes were held by banks and brokers after the
  international tin council's, itc, buffer stock manager halted
  support operations on the lme on behalf of the 22 members
  nations of the international tin agreement.
the overhang of metal was reduced further by broker
  shearson lehman brothers, which earlier this year reported
  having sold its itc-related holdings and halved its overall tin
  position.
analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in european tin
  prices and movements are still expected to be largely related
  to currency fluctuations, unless significant consumer demand
  emerges for the third quarter.
the association of tin producing countries, atpc, has made
  efforts since the collapse of the ita to achieve higher world
  prices by attempting to bring all major producers under an
  export control umbrella, but to date brazil and china, two
  major producers, remain unaffected by the atpc argument and
  apparently are continuing to offer material at discounts to
  consumers in main european trading centres, dealers said.

reagan urges fulfillment of exchange accords
  president reagan, preparing to depart
  for the venice economic summit on wednesday, said the united
  states and its allies must fulfill agreements on exchange rate
  stability.
"economic policy decisions made last year in tokyo, and at
  this year's meetings of group of 7 finance ministers in paris
  and in washington, cannot be ignored or forgotten," he said.
"the commitments made at these meetings need to be
  translated into action," reagan said in a pre-summit speech
  celebrating the 40th anniversary of the marshall plan.

reagan hints u.s.
wants help in patrolling gulf
  president reagan said he would discuss
  the mideast gulf situation with allied leaders at next week's
  venice economic summit and hinted he would seek their help in
  preserving free navigation.
in a speech prepared for delivery as the united states made
  plans to protect 11 kuwaiti oil tankers from iranian attack,
  reagan said the american people were aware that "it is not our
  interests alone that are being protected."
saying that allied dependence on gulf oil was no secret,
  reagan declared, "during the upcoming summit in venice, we will
  be discussing the common security interests shared by the
  western democracies in the mideast gulf.
"the future belongs to the brave.
free men should not cower
  before such challenges, and they should not expect to stand
  alone."
reagan will meet the leaders of britain, france, west
  germany, italy, canada and japan at the economic summit, which
  will take place in venice june 8-10.
the 13th annual top-level meeting of the major industrial
  democracies will take place against a backdrop of rising
  congressional concern over reagan's plan to protect gulf
  shipping and demands that the allies do more.
these concerns were heightened by the may 17 iraqi missile
  attack on the u.s. frigate stark which killed 37 seamen.
"they died while guarding a chokepoint of freedom, deterring
  aggression and reaffirming america's willingness to protect its
  vital interests," reagan said.
in a pre-summit speech celebrating the 40th anniversary of
  the marshall plan, reagan, who spoke to an audience of foreign
  affairs experts, also pledged to push for economic expansion by
  west germany and japan to bolster the world trading system.
"while the vibrancy of the u.s. economy has contributed
  enormously to the world expansion, preserving a growing world
  economy is the business of every member of the world trading
  community," he said.
"it will be made clear, especially to our friends in japan
  and the federal republic of germany, that growth-oriented
  domestic policies are needed to bolster the world trading
  system on which they depend."
reagan coupled this appeal with a call for compliance with
  allied accords on exchange rate stability.
"economic policy decisions made last year in tokyo and at
  this year's meetings of group of seven finance ministers in
  paris and in washington cannot be ignored or forgotten," he
  said.
"the commitments made at these meetings need to be
  translated into action."

andriessen hints fats/oil tax could go to summit

ec farm ministers have been unable to agree the tax, one of

the tax, which would apply on both domestically-produced
  and imported oils and fats, has been fiercely opposed by the
  united states and developing countries' vegetable and marine
  oil producers.
bilzerian prepared to tender for pay n'pak &lt;pnp>
  investor paul bilzerian said if pay n'
  pak stores inc enters into a merger accord with him he will
  immediately begin a tender offer for 7.5 mln shares for 20 dlrs
  per share in cash.
bilzerian told reuters he believes his offer is superior to
  a leveraged buyout proposal disclosed in an announcement by the
  company this morning.
the company said it is evaluating both proposals.
bilizerian said he was optimistic his offer will be accepted at
  a meeting of the board of directors wednesday.
officials of pay
  n' pak did were not immediately available for comment.
bilzerian said he has a pool of 150 mln dlrs raised by
  shearson lehman brothers inc available for the tender and "we
  may add a bank to that."
"we've submitted an agreement we're prepared to sign," he
  said.
shares not accepted in bilzerian's tender would be
  exchangeable for 20 dlrs in convertible preferred stock.
asked what would happen if the leveraged buyout group,
  which the company did not identify, topped his offer between
  now and the board meeting, bilzerian said he expected an
  opportunity to respond.
pay n' pak gave no details about the buyout group, but did
  say the offer was contingent on financing and on an agrreement
  regarding management's equity participation.
bilzerian said it was his understanding that the management
  particpation was "nominal."
pay n' pak fell 1-1/2 to 19.
arbitrageurs said there was
  disappointment that neither of the offers topped 20 dlrs.
"we were expecting an offer north of (above) 21 or 22
  dlrs," said one arbitrageur.
the leveraged buyout plan was for
  17.50 dlrs per share in cash and 2.50 dlrs in 13-1/2 pct
  cumulative preferred stock.
robert cheadle, analyst at montgomery securities, said "you
  have to ask yourself why no one in the industry made a bid."
scott drysdale, analyst at birr wilson securities, said the
  company has not made the best strategic moves over the years.
"they have not done the right things at the right time," he
  said, and as a result earnings per share have steadily declined
  since 1984.
the 57 cts per share in earnings reported for the
  fiscal year ended in february was lower than 1978's earnings,
  he said.
earnings totaled 5.7 mln dlrs on revenue of 398.4 mln
  dlrs.
drysdale said pay n' pak has better trained sales people
  than many competitors, but it competes on price even though
  competitors have lower costs.
the result is squeezed margins.
he noted that there have been no other publicly identified
  bidders stepping forward since the company rejected an earlier
  bilzerian proposal in mid-april.
another arbitrageur said it might not be too late for
  another bidder to get in the game.
he speculated that someone
  in the same home improvement business might be able to offer a
  deal for stock that would top both the buyout proposal and
  bilzerian's plan.

major u.s. oil pipeline shut down by floods
  flooding in the red river on the
  texas/oklahoma border has shut down the basin pipeline, a
  24-inch pipeline that transports as much as 300,000 barrels per
  day of sweet and sour crudes from texas to cushing, okla, a
  texaco pipeline co spokesman confirmed.
"the water is rushing by so fast that we can't get any
  divers down to assess the damage but there is some possibility
  that the pipeline could be up by the end of the week," a company
  source said.
the pipeline transmits roughly two-thirds sour crude and
  one-third sweet crude oil from the midland, texas region.
texaco sources said that if the pipeline service is
  restored by friday there would be little problem in restoring
  oil which has been lost to the flood.
"but if the pipeline is down more than 10 days it will be
  difficult to make up without prorationing and we would not like
  to proration this pipeline, if we don't have to."
the basin pipeline is jointly owned by atlantic richfield
  corp &lt;arc>, shell oil co, a subsidiary of the royal dutch/shell
  group &lt;rd> and texaco inc &lt;tx>, which is the pipeline's
  operator.
peter beutel, analyst at elders futures inc, said crude
  oil futures contracts on new york mercantile exchange rose to
  new highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break.
july crude futures of west texas intermediate traded up to
  19.60 dlrs a barrel, a rise of more than 20 cts.
cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers of
  wti raising offers to 19.60 dlrs a barrel.
sour crudes, which would be most affected by the pipeline
  shutdown, however, were slow to react to the news with west
  texas sour and alaska north slope holding 50 cts to one dlr a
  barrel below wti, respectively.
dan stevens, manager of public and government affairs at
  texaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five days
  but that will depend on when the water level of the red river
  recedes.
there is already evidence that the water level is
  dropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the area
  affecting the pipeline, stevens said.
he said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged was
  underground and at a distance from the red river that flooded.
the pipeline runs over the red river and under the subsoil
  nearby, according to stevens.
he said some of this subsoil was
  apparently washed away.
the potential for environmental damage is being downplayed
  at this time despite the volume of oil that runs through this
  line.
texaco's stevens said that aerial surveillance has not
  found any crude on the water in the river or in lake texoma,

takeover speculation lifts hutton &lt;efh> shares
  e.f. hutton group inc shares rose on
  speculation the company would receive a takeover offer, traders
  said.
hutton's stock also was affected by a newspaper report that
  first boston corp &lt;fbc> accumulated almost five pct of hutton's

congressman says u.s. unprepared for oil cutoff
  rep. mike synar said today that while
  president reagan is ready to use military force to protect
  kuwait tankers in the gulf, the united states is ill-prepared
  at home to deal with a new energy crisis.
synar, democrat of oklahoma, made his remarks in comments
  on a study by the general accounting office (gao) on the u.s.
  participation in the 1985 test of the emergency oil sharing
  program of the international energy agency.
the iea, an alliance of 21 oil consuming countries, was
  formed after the 1973-74 arab oil embargo to find ways to deal
  with any future oil cutoff.
synar said, "the president is prepared to take military
  action to protect kuwaiti oil tankers but has been unwilling to
  take less dangerous, equally-important action to prepare our
  nation for the next energy crisis."
reagan said the u.s. military would protect kuwaiti oilers
  to assure the west of a continuing supply of middle east oil,
  increasingly being threatened by the iranian-iraqi war.
synar,
  who asked for the gao report after criticism of u.s. action in
  a previous iea test, said the united states successfully
  advocated a test limited to training participants in oil
  sharing procedures and the system's mechanical aspects.

lead-zinc mine, a cominco spokesman said.
it had no meeting scheduled with the other three striking
  locals, which rejected a tentative three-year contract
  saturday, cominco spokesman richard fish said.

  living increase tied to the canadian consumer price index, but
  no wage increase.

  pct voted no and 45.5 pct voted yes, the union said.
the three locals represent about 2,600 production and
  maintenance workers, while the remaining two locals cover about
  600 office and technical workers.
the office and technical workers last negotiated may 21.
production at trail and kimberley has been shut down since the
  strike began may 9 and cominco has had to declare force
  majeure, which means the company may be unable to honor
  contracts for products from the smelter and mine.
each of the five locals have separate contracts, all of
  which expired april 30, but the main issues are similar.
the trail smelter, about 400 miles east of vancouver,
  produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons of
  lead last year.
the sullivan mine at kimberley, about 450 miles
  east of vancouver, produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year,

uspci &lt;upc> seen rejecting union pacific bid
  share bid made last wednesday by union pacific corp (unp), 
  analysts said.
"the offer is inadequate," said douglas augenthaler, an
  analyst with e.f. hutton, noting that it does not represent the
  needed premium over the company's fundamental value based on
  earnings estimates.
uspci, which has 8.7 mln shares outstanding, was trading at
  48-1/8, down 3/8.
uspci vice president of finance larry shelton said he could
  not comment on the adequacy of the offer or on when the board
  would meet to consider it.
augenthaler said that while uspci was trading at only 34
  dlrs a share at the time of the takeover bid, its announcement
  that same day of higher earnings expectations changed its
  value.
uspci said its second quarter earnings would exceed
  analysts expectations of 24 to 30 cts a share.
at that price, uspci could maintain a stock price in the
  low 40s, augenthaler said.
hutton revised its 1987 earnings estimate for the waste
  management concern to 1.40 dlrs a share from 1.20 dlrs on the
  announcment, he said.
it lifted its 1988 projection to 1.90
  dlrs a share from 1.70 dlrs.
in addition, analysts said the hazardous waste management
  business holds significant growth potential.
the industry has
  grown from 16 to 35 pct over the last five years, based on
  earnings per share, said jeffrey klein, an analyst with kidder
  peabody and co.
the industry is expected to continue growing at
  15 to 35 pct over the next five years, he said.
augenthaler said the 43-dlr-a-share offer, or 375 mln dlrs
  total, would be a bargain for union pacific.
the transportation
  and energy company would both gain entry into a profitable
  business and win cost-control benefits, he said.
"union pacific has what are rumored to be some fairly
  signficant environmmental problems of its own," he said.
herb mee jr., president of beard oil co (bec), which holds
  a 30.4 pct stake in uspci, said last week union pacific's offer
  was "grossly inadequate."
total petroleum &lt;tpn> shuts texas pipelines
  total petroleum na &lt;tpn> shut down
  several small crude oil pipelines operating near the
  texas/oklahoma border last friday as a precaution against
  damage from local flooding, according to gary zollinger,
  manager of operations.
total shut a 12-inch line that runs across the ouachita
  river from wynnewood to ardmore with a capacity of 62,000 bpd
  as well as several smaller pipelines a few inches wide with
  capacities of several thousand bpd or less, zollinger said.
the basin pipeline, a major pipeline running 300,000 bpd,
  run by a consortium of other oil companies, was closed today.
one other small pipeline that total also closed has a
  capacity of 3,000 to 4,000 bpd and crosses the red river in
  fargo, texas, zollinger said.
he said the closed pipelines run under river water and
  could be damaged as the flooded rivers erode the river banks
  and expose the piping.
zollinger said total is waiting for the river waters to
  recede before they reactivate the pipelines.

      doe alleged trigon caused overcharges of 624,208 dlrs by
  improperly classifying its oil as "newly discovered crude," a
  classification that allowed charging higher prices during a
  period of price controls.
it said the proposed settlements would resolve disputes
  over possible violations by the five parties.
doe added that in

  violations or non-compliance with its regulations.

nppc appeal on canadian pork dismissed
  the u.s. court of international trade has
  upheld the international trade commission's refusal to extend
  countervailing duties on canadian hogs to include pork
  products, the national pork producers' council said.
the court's ruling came in an appeal to the trade
  commission's decision filed by the pork producers' council.
council president tom miller said he was disappointed by
  the court ruling and said the council will accelerate
  activities in support of an amendment to the 1930 tariff act
  that would address the objections outlined in the trade
  commission's ruling.
the commission had said there was insufficient economic
  integration between the pork production industry and the pork
  packing industry to justify extending the duty on live hogs to
  fresh, chilled or frozen pork.
the legislation has already passed the house of
  representatives and recently passed the senate finance
  committee.
it is expected to be considered by the full senate
  by the end of the summer.
an appeal by the canadian pork council that the current
  countervailing duty on canadian hogs entering the u.s. be
  lifted is pending before the court.

edelman group cuts burlington &lt;bur> stake
  new york investor asher edelman and
  dominion textile inc &lt;dtx.t>, who are currently seeking to
  acquire burlington industries inc in a hostile tender offer,
  said they lowered their stake in the company.
in a filing with the secruties and exchange commission, the
  edelman/dominion group, known as samjens acqusition corp, said
  it sold options to buy 258,800 burlington common shares,
  reducing its stake in the company to 3,408,813 shares, or 12.33
  pct, from 3,667,313 shares, or 13.3 pct.
the group said the sale, which represented all the
  burlington options it owned, was made may 28 for 8.7 mln dlrs.
the edelman/dominion group last week sweetened its hostile
  tender offer to 77 dlrs a share, after burlington agreed to a
  leveraged buyout by a morgan stanley and co-backed group for 76
  dlrs a share.
but the edelman/dominion group, which has litigation
  pending against burlington, also said it has held talks with
  morgan stanley about "the possibility of settlement of
  outstanding matters among" it, morgan stanley and burlington.
entertainment marketing tops crazy eddie offer
  a quickly growing texas-based
  distributor of electronics products offered 240 mln dlrs
  for crazy eddie inc &lt;crzy>, the leading new york city
  electronics retailer, or one dlr per share more than its
  founder has bid.
the 8-dlr-a-share offer by entertainment marketing inc &lt;em>
  for crazy eddie comes less than two weeks after founder eddie
  antar and a firm controlled by the belzbergs of canada
  announced a bid to take the 32-store crazy eddie chain private.
analysts said entertainment marketing, whose revenues and
  profits quadrupled in 1986, may be looking to break into the
  highly competitive new york city retail market for consumer
  electronics, the nation's biggest, at a time the fortunes of
  electronics retailers have sagged.
the analysts questioned whether houston-based entertainment
  marketing, founded by a former electronics retailer but whose
  present buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors, had
  the management expertise for retailing or was merely trying to
  drive up the price of the crazy eddie shares it already owns.
"i have mixed feelings," said analyst dennis telzrow of
  eppler, geurin and turner, a dallas brokerage.
"on the one hand
  it's probably a cheap price.
on the other hand, does
  entertainment marketing have the management talent to run it
  and will the crazy eddie people leave?"
"it's a risky strategy for entertainment marketing," said
  analyst eliot laurence of wessels arnold and henderson, a
  minneapolis brokerage.
"electronics retailing is very management
  concentrated; they'd want to keep crazy eddie's management in
  place."
laurence said that, since entertainment marketing already
  owns 4.3 percent of crazy eddie's 31.3 million shares, it may
  be trying to get the antar-belzberg group to increase its
  7-dlr-a-share offer.
shares of crazy eddie, which have jumped from the high
  4-dlr range to above 7 dlrs since the antar-belzberg bid was
  announced may 20, rose another 50 cents monday to 8.375 a share
  in over-the- counter trading.
antar, the reclusive founder of the chain in the new york
  city, philadelphia and connecticut areas, said last month that
  his group controlled 14 percent of crazy eddie's shares.
a crazy eddie spokesman said the company's board has taken
  no decision on the antar-belzberg offer, worth some 187 mln dlrs
  since they own more shares than entertainment marketing.
he
  would not comment on the new offer.
entertainment marketing sells computer products such as
  disk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods to
  retailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly to
  consumers by cable television.
in fiscal 1986, ending last january, its revenues rose to
  87.9 mln dlrs from 21.3 mln dlrs the previous year.
net profit
  went to 3.2 mln dlrs from 750,000 dlrs in 1985.
entertainment marketing, whose chief executive officer,
  elias zinn, once ran an electronics retailing business, said in
  a statement it had committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchase
  of crazy eddie and had retained dean witter reynolds inc to
  assist in financing the balance.
analyst telzerow estimated that the company would have to
  borrow about 100 mln dlrs to complete the proposed buyout since
  crazy eddie has cash and other assets worth about the same
  amount.
shares of entertainment marketing were up 12.5 cents monday
  to 9.50.

investors may take computerland public
  the investor group that has agreed to
  buy &lt;computerland corp> will likely take the leading personal
  computer retailer public or sell it to other investors,
  industry analysts said.
"now's a good time," said joe levy of international data
  corp. "the personal computer industry has bottomed out and is
  on the way up again," he said.
earlier today, closely held computerland, the largest pc
  retailing chain in the country, said it agreed to be bought by
  an investor group led by e.m. warburg pincus and co, new york.
neither computerland, which is 96 pct owned by its founder,
  william h. millard, nor e.m. warburg, a money management and
  venture capital firm, would disclose the value of the
  transaction.
analysts estimated that computerland, whose 800 stores
  generated 1.4 billion dlrs in sales last year, would fetch  150
  mln dlrs to 250 mln dlrs.
computerland franchise owners pay
  royalties averaging 5.9 pct to the parent company.
officials for e.m. warburg referred all questions to
  computerland.
computerland officials could not immediately be
  reached for comment.

burlington &lt;bur> hearing to continue tomorrow
  u.s. district court judge eugene
  a. gordon said he plans to issue a decision tomorrow on
  burlington industries inc's request for an injunction to stop
  samjens acquisition corp's takeover bid for the company.
wall street sources have said the outcome of the case could
  be pivotal in determining the winner in the fierce takeover
  battle for burlington, the largest u.s. textile maker.
gordon presided over six hours of argument today by lawyers
  for burlington and samjens, a partnership formed by dominion
  textile inc and new york investor asher edelman.
hearings are scheduled to continue tomorrow.
a preliminary
  injunction would hold up samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer until
  the case is decided.
burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlr
  buyout from morgan stanley group inc &lt;ms>, one dlr per share
  lower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by samjens
  last week.
burlington has not responded to the new samjens
  offer.
burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that edelman and
  dominion used illegally obtained confidential information about
  the company in making their takeover attempt.
that information, burlington said, was provided by james
  ammeen, a former burlington executive, through painewebber
  group inc &lt;pwj>.
ammeen, who had worked for burlington for 23
  years, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of burlington's
  sales reporting to him.
when he left burlington in november,
  1985, burlington said he signed a contract promising never to
  divulge inside information about the company.
burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he began
  working with a painewebber employee on a hostile plan to
  "takeover the company, dismember the company and displace its
  management," burlington lawyer hubert humphrey said.
samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information from
  painewebber, but argued the information was public information
  and could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts or
  burlington's public financial statements.
burlington lawyers said painewebber and ammeen met with
  edelman and dominion in november and continued to meet with
  them until a couple of days before edelman and dominion went
  public april 24 with their intention to take over the company.
burlington lawyers claim dominion's board decided to attempt a
  takeover of burlington after ammeen met with the board in
  february.
burlington lawyers said edelman and dominion held
  discussions with painewebber and ammeen about acting as
  financial advisers to samjens.
but they allege talks broke off
  because painewebber and ammeen could not satisfy edelman and
  dominion with a written statement that they did not provide
  inside information.
lawyers for samjens contended that painewebber and ammeen
  withdrew as potential advisers because burlington chairman
  frank greenberg had called a painewebber executive and
  threatened legal action if painewebber got involved in an
  effort to takeover burlilgnton.
"the ultimate question is not the price per share or the
  profit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct for
  those who would takeover an american company," said burlington
  lawyer humphrey.
burlington lawyers also contended that burlington, as the
  largest manufacturer of denim in the united states, would be in
  violation of anti-trust laws if it acquired dominion, canada's
  largest textile maker.
dominion has denim manufacturing plants
  in georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market,
  the lawyers said.
samjens' lawyers discounted the concern.
they said the
  market for denim is more fragmented than burlington contends
  and that burlington has the ability to switch between light
  weight and heavy weight denim production as demand and price
  dictate.
samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed by
  burlington in canada, in which it said it was considering a bid
  for dominion.
"surely, what would have been sauce for the goose
  would have been sauce for the gander," said sidney rosdeitcher,
  a samjens lawyer.
edelman details burlington &lt;bur> options sale
  a tender offer of asher edelman and
  dominion textile ltd &lt;dtx.to> for burlington idustries inc is
  not affected by the investors' sale of options to buy
  burlington stock, according to an associate of edelman.
noting that "our tender offer is definitely in place" the
  aide said the investors are prohibited by securities and
  exchange commission regulations from exercising options as long
  as a tender offer is open.
the options are due to expire at the
  end of june.
he said the may 28 sale of options to buy 258,800
  burlington shares was thus a "non-event."
cont'l materials &lt;cuo> ends consideration of bid
  continental materials corp said its
  directors decided not to give further consideration to
  "business combination" proposed by a stockholder group that
  holds 5.2 pct of continental materials stock.
continental materials said the offer had been received from
  continental associates, a group of st. louis businessmen.
according to continental materials, the group said may 11 it
  might boost its stake in continental materials.
but the group
  also said in a letter last week to the company that the group
  had no financing.
the board "did not consider it an official
  offer," a continental materials spokeswoman said.
ameribanc &lt;ainv.o>, cardinal end acquisition

venezuela gets 300 mln dlrs credit for aluminum
  venezuela has obtained more than 300 mln
  dlrs in financing for industrial projects and increased its
  lines of credit for import financing, finance minister manuel
  azpurua said.
'we can say that we are achieving the recuperation of
  credit, but that cannot be done overnight,' azpurua said in a
  television interview.
he said a credit agreement for 100 mln marks will be signed
  this week with the german state bank kreditanstalt fur
  wiederaufbau (kfw), to finance an expansion of the state
  aluminum company venalum.
the credit will be divided into two separate agreements,
  one for 85 mln marks with an interest rate of 6.13 pct, and
  another for 15 mln marks, at 6.20 pct.
azpurua said financing has also been obtained for expansion
  of alcasa, another state aluminum company, and for projects in
  the state steel and petrochemical industries.
yesterday, he said venezuela obtained two new credits of
  5.0 mln dlrs each for export financing, one from credit du nord
  of france and the other from britain's midland bank.
the venezuelan government has been criticised at home for
  failing to obtain new credits, despite its insistence on
  repaying foreign debt according to the terms of a rescheduling
  accord reached last february.
azpurua recently visited tokyo hoping to acquire new
  credits for industrial expansions but clinched no agreements.
japanese officials refused to allow a new issue of venezuelan
  bonds until the country regains its 'triple a' credit rating.
u.s. trade data seen as key to dollar trend
  the dollar's recent signs of stability
  have raised hopes that its 27-month decline may be nearly over,
  but most currency analysts refuse to commit themselves until
  after the june 12 release of u.s. trade data for april.
"the trade data will be a deciding factor to see if the
  dollar has bottomed out," said jim mcgroarty of discount corp.
since february 1985, the dollar has nearly halved its value
  against the yen and the mark as part of an officially
  orchestrated campaign to make u.s. goods more competitive on
  world markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances.
on april 27, the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 137.25 yen
  but has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks,
  topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months.
many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen far
  enough to ease the trade deficit's drag on the u.s. economy.
the u.s. trade gap narrowed to 13.6 billion dlrs in march
  from 15.1 billion in february and is expected to show continued
  improvement in april in volume, if not in real, terms.
keiichi udagawa of bank of tokyo in new york said that if
  further progress is reported, the dollar would head back up
  towards 150 yen.
"there is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomed
  out for the medium term," added tom campbell of first national
  bank of chicago.
other factors supporting this bullish view were growing
  expectations that federal reserve chairman paul volcker would
  be reappointed for a third four-year term in august, japan's
  larger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and 
  more favorably technical chart signals, analysts said.
the dollar was also aided by japan's moves to dampen
  speculative selling in tokyo and by reports of active central
  bank intervention to support the dollar.
the federal reserve bank of new york said last week that
  the u.s. monetary authorities bought more than four billion
  dlrs during the february-april period -- the largest amount
  since the dollar crisis of the late 1970's.
discount corp's mcgroarty described the fed's intervention
  volume as "impressive".
james o'neill of marine midland bank was not so positive,
  however: "the dollar has not yet bottomed out.
after the trade
  data are released, the dollar could fall towards 1.77 marks and
  140 yen."
similarly, natsuo okada of sumitomo bank in new york
  warned, "i don't think the dollar has bottomed out yet."
although the dollar could rise as high as 146.50 yen, okada
  said market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline of
  the u.s. trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure.
currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reaction
  to the seven-nation economic summit on june 8 to 10 in venice,
  which is likely to focus on the implementation of previous
  commitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives.
president reagan said today, "economic policy decisions
  made last year in tokyo and at this year's meetings of group of
  seven finance ministers in paris and washington cannot be
  ignored or forgotten."
"the commitments made at these meetings need to be
  translated into action," he added in a speech, celebrating the
  40th anniversary of the marshall aid plan for europe.
now that tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package,
  analysts expected bonn and the dollar/mark rate to bear the
  brunt of u.s. calls for further action.
marine midland's o'neill said, "pressure will build up on
  germany to take stimulative action like japan."
some japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollar
  could hold above 145 yen for some months it could also come
  under attack again if it seems the latest economic package is
  not having much impact on japan's economy and its trade
  surplus.
reflecting a longer-term uncertainty, some some trust
  banks and japanese insurers are keeping their short dollar
  positons hedged against exchange losses in their foreign
  portfolios, while some others have started covering those short
  positions, japanese bank dealers said.
court upholds bank building &lt;bb> self-tender
  bank building and equipment corp of
  america said the delaware chancery court denied a stockholder's
  request for a preliminary injunction against an
  offer for bank building stock made by the company and its
  employee stock ownership plan and trust.
bank building said the joint offer is for 780,300 shares of
  bank building stock at 14 dlrs a share.
the offer is scheduled
  to expire midnight (edt) on june 2.
bank building also said its board set july 30 as the date
  of the company's annual meeting, with a record date of july
  six.
harcourt &lt;hbj> debentures may trigger suit
  holders of convertible subordinated
  debentures of harcourt brace jovanovich inc threatened to sue
  the company if they do not get more information about how their
  investment will be affected by the company's proposed
  recapitalization plan.
the holders, none of whom was willing to be identified,
  said although harcourt has urged that they convert their shares
  to common stock by the june eight record date for a special
  dividend, they were unable to determine if it might be better
  for them to continue holding the debentures.
"there are rumors that various houses will bring litigation
  if we don't get answers," said a wall street source.
officials
  of harcourt declined to comment, citing a suit brought by
  british publisher robert maxwell whose has been trying to
  acquire harcourt.
executives of first boston inc, harcourt's financial
  adviser, did not return a telephone call seeking comment.
when it announced its recapitalization may 26 harcourt
  advised holders of the 6-3/8 pct convertible subordinated
  debentures due 2011 to convert into common by the june eight
  record date for the company's special dividend.
harcourt's special dividend pays 40 dlrs per share in cash
  plus a security worth 10 dlrs.
holders would also retain stock
  in the recapitalized firm.
the debentures had been convertible at 34 dlrs per share.
harcourt's may 26 announcement said the conversion price would
  be adjusted according to the indenture covering the securities.
arbitrageurs said the conversion formula yielded a "negative
  number" and thus they needed further information from the
  company.
venezuela obtained 300 million dlrs in credits
  venezuela has obtained more than 300 mln
  dlrs in financing for industrial projects and has also
  increased its lines of credit for import financing, finance
  minister manuel azpurua said.
"we can say that we are achieving the recuperation of
  credit, but that cannot be done overnight," azpurua said in a
  television interview.
azpurua said a credit agreement for 100 mln marks will be
  signed this week with the german state bank kreditanstalt fur
  wiederaufbau (kfw), to finance an expansion of the state
  aluminum company venalum.
the credit will be divided into two separate agreements,
  one for 85 mln marks with an interest rate of 6.13 pct, and
  another for 15 mln marks, at 6.20 pct.
azpurua said financing
  had also been obtained for the expansion of alcasa, another
  state aluminum company, as well as for projects in the state
  steel and petrochemical industries.
he did not provide details.
yesterday, after a meeting of leaders of the ruling accion
  democratica party, azpurua said venezuela had obtained two new
  credits of five mln dlrs each for export financing, one from
  credit du nord of france and the other from the midland bank of
  great britain.
the finance minister's statements came as the government is
  under sharp criticism for failing to obtain new credits,
  despite its insistence on repaying the foreign debt according
  to the terms of a rescheduling accord reached last february.
azpurua and other senior economic officals returned from a
  trip to tokyo last week in which they hoped to acquire new
  credits for industrial expansions, but no agreements were
  reached.
japanese officials also refused to allow a new issue of
  venezuelan debt bonds because until the country regains its
  'triple a' credit classification.
south korea increases duty on crude imports
  south korea has increased its duty on crude
  oil imports to 4.29 dlrs a barrel from 3.29 dlrs, effective
  today, the energy ministry said.
the duty, to raise funds for special energy projects, was
  adjusted after average crude import prices rose to 16.85 dlrs a
  barrel in april, from 16.65 dlrs in march and 13.08 dlrs in
  april 1986, ministry officials said.
a separate 24.5 pct import tax on crude oil is unchanged.
equiticorp tasman to bid for monier ltd
  &lt;equiticorp tasman ltd> (etl) said it will
  offer 4.15 dlrs a share cash for all the issued capital of
  monier ltd &lt;mnra.s>, currently the subject of a 3.80 dlrs a
  share bid by csr ltd &lt;csra.s>.
alternatively, etl will offer three shares plus 82 cents
  cash for each monier share, it said in a statement.
as previously reported, etl moved into the market for
  monier shares last week, taking its stake to 13.7 pct by
  friday.
it now holds 14.99 pct, the maximum allowed without foreign
  investment review board (firb) approval.
etl is classified as
  foreign because of its new zealand base.
the etl cash offer values monier's issued capital of 156.28
  mln shares at 649 mln dlrs, against 593 mln for the csr bid.
based on the current price of etl shares of 1.05 dlrs, the
  alternative is worth 3.97 dlrs per share, but etl said the
  value placed on its shares for the offer aproximates to the
  diluted asset backing of etl as at march 31.
etl said the offer will have no minimum acceptance
  conditions and will be subject to australian foreign investment
  and u.s. hart-scott-rodino anti-trust clearances.
etl chairman allan hawkins said in the statement that the
  shareholding in monier was a long term investment.
etl and its &lt;feltex international ltd> associate have
  targetted the building products sector as an area of expansion
  and monier fits well with this aim, he added.
monier chairman bill locke said in a separate statement
  that the independent directors of monier intend to recommend
  acceptance of the etl bid in the absence of a higher bid.
he also said monier will not now proceed with the
  one-for-two bonus issue announced with its interim results on
  march 19 in view of the proposed takeover bids.
as previously reported, the csr offer involves a complex
  put and call option deal with monier's major shareholder,
  redland plc &lt;rdld.l>, which gives redland the choice of
  accepting the csr offer for its 49.8 pct stake or moving to
  50.1 pct within six months of the bid closing.
csr officials have made it clear that they see redland
  taking the second option, resulting in the two companies
  running monier as a joint venture.
csr officials have also said they had no intention of
  raising the company's bid for monier after etl's intervention
  became public last week.
venezuela tightens foreign exchange restrictions
  venezuela's central bank has ordered
  venezuelan banks and exchange houses to cease foreign exchange
  operations with brokers based outside the country, according to
  a copy of a central bank telex made available to reuters.
the measure, confirmed by a brokerage firm here, has
  effectively cut off all foreign participation in venezuela's
  volatile currency market.
the telex, issued on may 19, was signed by carlos hernandez
  delfino, manager of the bank's department of international
  operations.
the telex said the restriction on business with foreign
  brokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreign
  exchange houses from selling dollars or other foreign
  currencies to anyone living outside venezuela.
in recent weeks the venezuelan government has denied
  rumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls to
  prop up the weakening bolivar.
but brokers said the central bank's move is seen as a de
  facto currency control.
"it is definitely a control in the sense
  that there's no longer complete freedom to operate," one broker
  here said.
"gradually they're imposing restrictions and the direction
  is towards complete control," the broker said.
the broker, who requested anonymity, said virtually all his
  venezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him since
  the central bank issued the telex and followed it up with
  telephone calls.
he said that before the restriction was imposed the volume
  of his firm's transactions with venezuela was about 10 mln dlrs
  a day.
"it was a frenetic market, it was really quite active," he
  said.
the broker said he saw no logical explanation for the
  prohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediary
  between venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks.
"we weren't buying dollars from venezuelans, that's
  ridiculous," he said.
"they've been on a rampage against
  foreigners."
the broker noted that two months ago venezuela's central
  bank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchange
  business outside venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pct
  reserve requirement.
in february, the central bank also prohibited trading in
  bolivar futures, the broker said.
"we used to have a forward market," he said.
"for a small
  currency it was miraculous."
he said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the u.s.
  dollar in 1986, would continue to slip from its current range
  of 28.35 to 28.50 because the central bank was rapidly running
  out of foreign reserves to support the currency on the free
  market.

tokyo - bundesbank's schlesinger sees no reason to lower interest rates

  tokyo - bundesbank's schlesinger sees no reason to lower interest rates
no reason to cut rates - bundesbank's schlesinger
  bundesbank vice president helmut
  schlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now.
with money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in
  may and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark,
  schlesinger told reuters that he was not convinced that a
  further cut in interest rates was needed.
the economy is picking up, after contracting by a
  seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter from
  the fourth, he added.
"we may have an increase in gnp starting
  in the second quarter," he said in an interview.
concerned by the first quarter downturn, the u.s. has been
  pressing west germany to pump up its economy and boost its
  imports, either through fiscal or monetary policy.
schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was
  mainly due to adverse weather conditions, just as occured in
  1986.
year-on-year growth was thus about two pct.
he estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole
  would probably be between one and two pct.
"it is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic
  demand does not grow strongly," he said, noting that interest
  rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample.
schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money
  stock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year pace
  of 7-1/2 to eight pct, well above the bundesbank's three to six
  pct target.
he said the target could still be achieved but much will
  depend on the direction of long-term capital flows.
heavy
  inflows, particularly in january around the time of the ems
  revaluation, boosted domestic money supply.
"there is still a certain hope that the net inflow of
  foreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit
  reversed," schlesinger said.
a major reason for the inflows was the market's conviction
  that the mark was headed higher.
"as we can see from the market,
  expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark have
  diminished," schlesinger said.
the recent widening of interest rate differentials, the
  fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period
  and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined
  towards stabilizing the dollar, he said.
asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar
  rise, as the u.s. did in march when the dollar rose above 1.87
  marks, he said this would depend on the circumstances.
at midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks.
"central banks are always in contact about these
  fluctuations but i cannot give any answer how they would react,"
  schelsinger said.
"one has to look at how it (the market) is moving," he said,
  adding, "it is not only our own case, it is also the american
  case."
he said that the west german export industry has been hit
  hard by the dollar's sharp fall and would probably like to see
  some correction now.
"but it wouldn't be good to have short-term
  fluctuations," he said.
"let us wait and see."
"it is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a very
  short period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level
  (of rates) as such," schlesinger said.
the sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices of
  such key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on west
  german inflation down year.
although there have recently been signs of inflation
  picking up, he said that this was due to changes in key
  commodity prices.
the underlying inflation rate this year would
  be unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said.
schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth
  was longer term, in that the economy was building up the
  potential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation.
the above-target growth of money supply over the past 16
  months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of
  targets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at the
  mid-year meeting of the bundesbank's council, schlesigner said.
but he added: "i don't see any great pressure to go away
  from it."
japan oil industry decontrol may lead to mergers
  deregulation of japan's oil industry could
  mean hardship for smaller firms and lead to their merging into
  bigger refining and marketing groups, industry sources said.
they said the relaxation of controls was now under review
  by the petroleum council, an advisory panel to the ministry of
  international trade and industry (miti).
a spokesman for a major firm said, "deregulation would bring
  about a reorganization.
if it's a by-product of freer
  competition, we have no choice but to accept it."
the council is due to close its discussions on june 12.
the sources said the council was likely to tell miti it
  should end its 50 year-old protection of the industry.
it
  should cut capacity to 3.8 mln barrels per day, about 75 pct of
  current capacity.
quotas should end for crude throughput and
  gasoline output, and oil tariffs should be abolished.
they said deregulation was vital to promote more
  competition and efficiency, and most saw it as inevitable.
"deregulation is taking place everywhere.
now it's our turn
  to see if we can survive cut-throat competition," said a source
  at one major japanese oil company.
a spokesman for a smaller refiner said, "we'll have a hard
  time surviving, but that's something we must go through."
"in addition to our streamlining and efficiency programs for
  the oil division, we will exert efforts towards branching out
  further into other lines such as real estate and travel
  agencies," he said.
larger companies are also streamlining.
nippon oil co ltd
  which had the largest share of refined products sales in the
  japanese market in fiscal 1985, cut nine pct of its refining
  capacity in fiscal 1986.
cosmo oil co ltd, the third largest seller of oil products
  in 1985, cut its workforce by some 20 pct last year, a
  spokesman for the company said.
between 1984 and 1986, on the recommendation of the
  council, 13 oil companies were integrated into 11 companies
  within seven refining and marketing groups to improve the
  efficiency of the industry.
oil industry sources said this structure was now likely to
  be streamlined further into five refining groups.
"miti means business.
it will urge the major seven groups to
  merge into five to build up their muscles," a source said.
a miti official told reuters he did not rule out the
  possibility of further mergers within the japanese oil industry
  in the event of the relaxation of oil controls.
he declined to officially confirm or deny that the
  petroleum council had recommended deregulatory measures but
  said that in principal miti would encourage a move towards
  deregulation.

japan ready to use diplomacy for gulf security
  japan was ready to use diplomacy to help
  maintain the security of the gulf, prime minister yasuhiro
  nakasone said.
but he told reporters japan should not cut its lines of
  communication with iran and iraq because its policy was to take
  a broad political stance.
officials of the foreign ministry
  said japan had maintained good relations with both iran and
  iraq, which have been at war since september 1980.
last week nakasone ruled out japanese military or financial
  help to patrol the waters of the gulf.
about 60 pct of japan's
  crude oil passes through the waterway.
president reagan said yesterday the threat to oil routes in
  the gulf from attacks by iran and iraq was high on the agenda
  for next week's g-7 summit in venice.
reagan has approved plans for the united states to step up
  its naval presence in the gulf despite congressional
  expressions of concern and he has called on u.s.
allies to help
  maintain freedom of navigation.
japan's constitution prevents its armed forces from being
  deployed overseas.
nakasone has said that washington
  understands this problem.
mees newsletter says oman offers oil discounts
  oman has granted term crude oil
  customers retroactive discounts from official prices of 30 to
  38 cents per barrel on liftings made during february, march and
  april, the weekly newsletter middle east economic survey (mees)
  said.
mees said the price adjustments, arrived at through
  negotiations between the omani oil ministry and companies
  concerned, are designed to compensate for the difference
  between market-related prices and the official price of 17.63
  dlrs per barrel adopted by non-opec oman since february.
malaysian rubber output recovers from wintering
  malaysian rubber production should
  return to normal levels this month after a hard wintering
  season, the malaysian rubber exchange and licensing board said
  in its latest review.
"as packers and remillers expect
  production to recover to normal levels in june, sellers will
  remain reserved in the near future," the review, dated may 14,
  said.
many consumers are holding off, waiting for the best time
  to buy.
the market is mindful of approaching summer holidays in
  industrial countries and there is an air of uncertainty beyond
  july, it said.
it gave no figures for the output drop.
central bank head says philippine growth on target
  the philippines' first quarter growth
  figures released yesterday indicated the government was likely
  to achieve its 1987 targets, central bank governor jose
  fernandez said in an interview.
the national economic development authority (neda)
  announced yesterday gross domestic product (gdp) grew 5.78 pct
  and gross national product (gnp) 5.53 pct in the first quarter
  from a year earlier.
"i don't see anything on the horizon that should cut it
  (growth) short," fernandez said.
neda said gnp had grown 3.56 pct and gdp 3.25 pct in the
  fourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier.
last year's gnp
  growth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct.
"certainly i do not see any shortage in external resources
  and if gnp growth continues at this level i would assume that
  domestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and
  would not be a stumbling block," fernandez said.
"i think even before the figures came out, simply looking at
  key indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power,
  showed that the economy was on a different track from last
  year," he said.
fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the
  first and second quarters because of the dry weather, and it
  could drop off in the third quarter.
he said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the
  manufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in
  1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986.
"that is not a seasonal thing, it is secular," he said.
he said the government had met all monetary targets set for
  the first quarter in consultation with the international
  monetary fund (imf).
it expected to draw down the fourth
  tranche from its 198 mln sdr stand-by arrangement soon.
the philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling
  58 mln sdrs from the arrangement expiring on april 23, 1988.
fernandez said an imf mission would visit here in july or
  august to review performance in the january-june period.
he said imf repayments were projected to total 1.56 billion
  dlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs.
repayments were inevitable and many countries would find their
  net repayments to the imf rising in the next few years.
"it means that since there will be a net drain on oda
  (official development assistance) accounts the commercial
  banking system will be requested to hold the line," he said.
it is an internal constraint that exists because the imf
  debt cannot be rescheduled, fernandez said.
the philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28
  billion dlr foreign commercial debt in march.
fernandez said central bank bills, introduced in march 1984
  to mop up excess liquidity, had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos in
  april 1986.
but their unwinding on maturity dates, started in
  october last year, had almost been completed.
he said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding level
  touched 95.44 billion pesos on may 20, were going well.
"treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool," he said.
commenting on the country's foreign debt fernandez said, "i
  think the philippine debt stock looms large because our own
  receipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap
  forward as might have been suitable."
the foreign debt is projected by the central bank to reach
  29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987.
neda said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the first
  quarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs.
fernandez said the government had targeted gnp growth of
  between six and 6.5 pct this year.
he cautioned that while
  growth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved.
fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some
  economists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to the
  dollar, ought to be devalued to make the country's exports more
  competitive.
"by being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the peso
  has already substantially devalued against all of the country's
  trading partners," he said.
on the proposed omnibus investment code, he said he was
  opposed to a clause which would allow the unrestricted
  repatriation abroad of investments made during the first two
  years after the imposition of the code.
the imposition of the code, scheduled for last january, has
  been delayed by objections from some business groups.
"i think any central bank, certainly this one after the
  events of the past two or two and a half years, has to be
  prudent.
this is not the time to throw all caution to the winds
  and i'm not about to do that," fernandez said.
"it would be ideal if we reach a point where movement of
  capital and earnings can be free," he said.
"we have had one year of reasonably good results.
certainly
  we continue to have a fairly heavy drain on our external
  availabilities simply by servicing our debts."
belgian february industry output down on year ago
  belgian industrial production, excluding
  construction and adjusted for seasonal and calendar influences,
  was provisionally 0.6 pct lower in february than a year
  earlier, the national statistics office said.
output in february was, however, 5.9 pct higher than in
  january.
a spokeswoman for the office said the production index,
  base 1980, rose to a provisional 108.8 in february from a
  provisional 102.7 in january, slightly revised from the 102.8
  originally estimated.
in february last year the index stood at
  109.5.
bundesbank sets new repurchase tender
  the bundesbank set a new tender for a
  28-day securities repurchase agreement, offering banks
  liquidity aid at a minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, a central bank
  spokesman said.
banks must make their bids by 1400 gmt today and funds
  allocated will be credited to accounts tomorrow.
banks must
  repurchase securities pledged on july 1.

german gnp figures publication delayed
  figures for first quarter 1987 west
  german gnp will be published on june 11 after they were
  provisionally scheduled for june 4, an official at the federal
  statistics office said.
the official said there had been a delay in gathering
  information for the data, which are expected to show that the
  west german economy contracted in the period.
a spokesman for the economics ministry in bonn said there
  was no political motivation behind publishing the figures on
  june 11, the day after the venice economic summit ends.
"there is no political motivation.
it is a purely technical
  matter," he added.
the west german government is expected to come under
  pressure in venice from both the u.s. and its european partners
  to stimulate domestic demand as a way of reducing international
  trade imbalances and contributing to world economic growth.
however, government officials have ruled out any further
  tax reduction packages to supplement a major program of
  stimulatory fiscal measures already underway.
helmut schlesinger, vice-president of the west german
  central bank, the bundesbank, said in tokyo today that gnp, the
  widest measure of a country's economic activity, fell in real
  terms by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first
  quarter compared with the fourth 1986 period.
the government has confirmed that growth was negative in
  the first 1987 quarter.
but year-on-year growth is expected to
  be about two pct.
schlesinger today repeated the bundesbank's reluctance to
  cut its official interest rates further.
its key discount rate,
  at three pct, is just above historical lows.
west german officials are likely to emphasise at the venice
  summit that domestic demand, which draws in goods from abroad,
  is already outstripping export performance, which has suffered
  from an 80 pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just over
  two years.
the government has pointed out that depressed exports are
  the main reason for the current weakness in the economy, but
  says that later in the year stronger domestic demand will
  compensate for this setback.
it expects gnp growth for the whole of 1987 of just under
  two pct, after a 2.4 pct rise in 1986.
stad rotterdam takes stake in swiss-owned insurer
  dutch insurer stad rotterdam anno 1720
  n.v. &lt;asrn.as> said from july 1 it will own 20 pct of the
  shares of &lt;europeesche verzekering maatschappij n.v.>, a
  fully-owned unit of swiss insurer &lt;union
  rueckversicherungs-gesellschaft>.
stad rotterdam chairman lucas van leeuwen told reuters it
  may raise its stake to a majority interest if the two companies
  are found to be sufficiently compatible.
van leeuwen said that due partly to the fact europeesche
  made losses in 1985 and 1986, the 20 pct stake was obtained at
  below the shares' intrinsic value.
he gave no precise sum.
the europeesche, which specialises in travel and recreation
  insurance, had a premium income of 150 mln guilders in 1986.
stad rotterdam's premium income in 1986 was 1.17 billion
  guilders, making it the fifth largest dutch insurer.
europeesche made a loss of nine mln guilders in 1985, which
  narrowed to 4.5 mln guilders in 1986, van leeuwen said.
he said the company was on course for independent recovery
  and was expected to reduce its losses further in 1987.
duffour igon gives backing to aga takeover bid
  french industrial gas group &lt;duffour et
  igon> has decided to back the takeover bid by swedish
  industrial gases group aga ab &lt;aga.st>, ending a lengthy battle
  between rival bidders from france, spain and west germany,
  duffour et igon chairman jean igon said.
the board agreed late last night to back the aga bid and
  advise its shareholders to accept the swedish group's latest
  offer of 4,410 francs per share, he told reuters.
the other main bidders were union carbide corp's &lt;uk.>
  french subsidiary &lt;union carbide france> and west germany's
  linde ag &lt;ling.f>.
aga topped rival bids for the gases distribution group in
  may by raising its offer to 4,410 francs from 4,000 francs.
this was accepted by spain's &lt;carburos metalicos sa> which
  sold aga six pct of duffour et igon's stock and the right of
  first refusal on the remaining nine pct of stock it holds.
it
  also won over the french midi-pyrenees development authority
  which agreed to sell aga its 20 pct stake in duffour et igon.
under aga's offer, shareholders can either accept a cash
  bid or exchange one share in duffour et igon for one bond of a
  nominal value of 4,410 francs with a 10 pct coupon issue by aga
  france sa.
the bond issue is guaranteed by the parent aga ab.
the takeover battle for the toulouse-based company, which
  controls eight pct of the french industrial gas distribution
  market, began on april 2 with an offer of 2,100 francs per
  share from union carbide france &lt;uk>.
aga's offer, which puts a price of 587 mln francs on the
  company, closes on june 24 and the results will be announced on
  july 21.
duffour et igon shares were quoted yesterday at 4,410
  francs, with no buyers, after a series of suspensions during
  the takeover tussle.
they traded at 856 francs on january 9
  before the first suspension.
santos to acquire total exploration australia
  santos ltd &lt;stos.s> said it would buy
  &lt;total exploration australia pty ltd> from &lt;total holdings
  (australia) pty ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of total-cie
  francaise des petroles &lt;tpn.pa>.
total exploration had interests ranging from 18.75 to 25
  pct in four blocks in permit atp259p in south-west queensland,
  santos said in a statement.
the santos group stakes will rise to between 52.5 and 70
  pct of the four atp259p blocks as a result of the purchase.
the
  price was not disclosed.
santos said a number of oil and gas fields have been
  discovered in the total exploration areas and that it regards
  them as having very good prospects for further discoveries.
total's reserves amount to 75 billion cubic feet of gas and
  5.5 mln barrels of oil and condensate, it said.
it said it will promote a vigorous exploration program in
  the areas for the rest of 1987 and in the future.
the acquisition is the latest in a series by santos as part
  of a program to expand from its origins in the south australian
  cooper basin.
poehl looks set for eight more years at bundesbank
  for currency dealers karl otto poehl is
  the scourge of speculators, for bankers he is the man who has
  played a key role in shaping the world's financial destiny for
  the last seven years, and for germans he is the guardian of the
  mark.
president of the powerful and independent west german
  central bank, the bundesbank, poehl is likely to have his
  contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the
  end of this year, government officials say.
(index of economic spotlights, see page ecra)
      but no official announcement has yet been made, raising
  eyebrows in west germany's business community.
the ebullient poehl spent seven years in bonn in top
  ministerial posts under the social democrats, now in
  opposition, before he moved to the bundesbank.
there has been speculation that chancellor helmut kohl
  would try to replace poehl with a man closer to his own
  christian democrats.
but officials noted that poehl has worked
  closely and successfully with finance minister gerhard
  stoltenberg since kohl's government took office in 1982.
poehl, the most senior central banker apart from paul
  volcker of the united states, enjoys a strong international
  reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up.
given these circumstances, kohl will probably overlook
  poehl's past as an adviser to former social democrat chancellor
  willy brandt, and top aide to helmut schmidt when he was
  finance minister, bankers said.
it was schmidt who, as
  chancellor, appointed poehl to his present job in 1980.
in recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the
  dollar, poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of
  the bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institution
  which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent
  inflation catching hold.
older germans can remember two bouts
  of galloping inflation this century.
but with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and
  inflation negligible so far this year, poehl thinks it is safe
  to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the
  dangers to the german economy of a bloated exchange rate.
"i am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the
  dollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the
  bundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark
  would endanger the economy in west germany," he told business
  journalists in frankfurt recently.
ute geipel, head of research at citibank ag, says that
  poehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.
"poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not
  focus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external
  economy," she said.
an economist at a german bank, who declined to be
  identified, said "if poehl is confirmed in his post, it will
  certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so
  rigidly oriented towards money supply."
one of poehl's great struggles recently has been to
  persuade the united states to stop "talking down" the dollar.
for
  poehl, the significance of the february louvre accord was that
  the united states agreed to join efforts to stabilise
  currencies.
the louvre accord was greeted with scepticism by currency
  dealers who said they would soon put it to the test.
but in
  fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.
"this is because the markets know - or perhaps because they
  don't know - what the central banks can do," poehl says of
  intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates
  round, making a speculator's position worthless.
poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist
  in the 1960s before starting his ministerial career.
a relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over
  a glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker.
he is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and
  play golf.
poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute
  for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.
"but you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount
  if you strike at the right moment," he said.
bundesbank dealers
  are very professional and skilled.
"they've burnt the fingers of
  many people," he said.
and unlike the speculators, poehl notes,
  the bundesbank dealers usually make a profit.

china seen unlikely to raise sugar imports
  china will not increase sugar imports
  substantially this year because of foreign exchange constraints
  and large stocks, despite falling production and rising
  domestic demand, traders and the official press said.
"despite rapid increases in domestic production over the
  last 30 years, imbalances between supply and demand continue to
  be extremely serious," the farmers daily said.
it said 1986
  plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives, because
  farmers could earn more from other crops and because technical
  and seed improvements had not been widely disseminated.
the official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop
  (november/march) at 4.82 mln tonnes, down from 5.2 mln a year
  earlier, and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year.
the yunnan 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500
  tonnes, the provincial daily said.
it gave no year-earlier
  figure.
output in guangxi was 1.04 mln tonnes, the new china
  news agency said without giving a year-earlier figure.
the nanfang daily said production in guangdong province
  fell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that the
  area under sugar was dropping.
"supply of cane (in guangdong) is inadequate," the newspaper
  said.
processing costs are rising and the economic situation of
  nearly all the mills is not good.
to guarantee supply of cane
  is a major problem."
a western diplomat said sugar output also fell n fujian,
  south china's fourth major producer, where there was a drop in
  area planted.
he said the rural sectors in guangdong and fujian were wel
  developed, enabling farmers to choose crops according to the
  maximum return, meaning that many had avoided sugar.
the farmers daily said a peasant in the ortheast province
  of heilongjiang could gross 108 yuan from one mu (0.0667
  hectares) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only
  70 from one mu of sugarbeet.
the paper said the profit margin of mills in china fell to
  4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980.
mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competed
  with each other for raw materialsx, it added.
this resulted in
  falling utilisation rates at big, mode{nised mills.
the price of sugar had not changed in 20 years, the
  official press has said.
customs figures showed china imported 1.18 mln tonnes of
  sugar in calendar 1986, down from 1.9 mln in 1985.
the diplomat said stocks at end-august 1986 were 2.37 mln
  tonnes, up from 1.92 a year earlier.
a foreign trader here said china accumulated large stocks
  in 1982-85 when provincial authorities were allowed to import
  sugar on their own authority.
this practice was stopped in 1986
  when the central government resumed control of imports.
"as china lacked storage, much of these imports was stored
  in qinghai, inner mongolia and other inland areas," the diplomat
  said.
the trader said transporting stocks from these areas to
  consumers in east and south china was a problem, particularly
  as coal had priority.
"how quickly they can move the sugar is
  one factor determining import levels," he said.
another factor was the quality of the harvest in cuba,
  china's major supplier through barter trade, he said.
"china bought two distress cargoes last week, for about
  152/153 dlrs a tonne," he added.
"china is not a desperate buyer
  now.
but if the cuban harvest is bad, it will have to go into
  the open market."
a japanese trader said peking's major concern regarding
  imports was price.
"while the foreign trade situation has improved this year,
  foreign exchange restraints persist," he said.
the diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about five
  pct a year but "a communist government is in a much better
  position to regulate demand than a capitalist one, if the
  foreign exchange situation demands it."
uae trade, current account surpluses narrow
  the united arab emirates recorded a
  1986 trade surplus of 12.2 billion dirhams, narrowing from 30.2
  billion in 1985, the central bank's latest bulletin shows.
the central bank said the lower surplus was mainly due to
  the decline in the value of exports and re-exports to 37.2
  billion dirhams from 54.2 billion in 1985.
this reflected the
  decline in oil prices last year and difficulties in marketing
  uae oil, the central bank added.
the surplus on the current account narrowed to 6.8 billion
  dirhams from 25.5 billion in 1985.
the overall balance showed a
  surplus of 4.8 billion after 2.6 billion in 1985.
kuwait rejects iranian spy boat charges
  kuwait, a target of iranian anger over the
  emirate's backing for iraq in the gulf war, today rejected
  charges that fishing vessels seized recently by iran were spy
  boats.
"there are no bases of truth to the contents of the iranian
  accusation on the nature of the operations of the vessels
  recently taken into custody by iran.
these vessels were out
  fishing," the foreign ministry said in a statement.
it said iranian charge d'affaires mohammad baqeri was
  summoned by the ministry yesterday to confer with foreign
  undersecretary suleiman majed al-shaheen.
the iranian news agency irna said on sunday iran had seized
  seven kuwaiti speed boats and detained their crew, who
  confessed to spying for iraq under the cover of fishing.
it said the boats were intercepted in the khur abdullah
  waterway which separates kuwait and iraq's faw peninsula at the
  head of the gulf, captured by iran last year.
the kuwaiti response came as iranian envoys toured gulf
  arab states saying responsibility for security and stability in
  the waterway was a regional matter.
a u.s. senate team was
  scheduled today to meet kuwait's crown prince and prime
  minister sheikh saad al-abdulla al-sabah and the defence and
  oil ministers.
today's foreign ministry statement, carried by the kuwait
  news agency kuna, said the recent detention of kuwaiti fishing
  vessels by iran was not the first.
tehran in the past had held back a number of vessels kuwait
  had sought to release through diplomatic contacts, it said.
"however, kuwait is perplexed that this time the iranian
  charges are accompanied by accusations that the vessels were
  undertaking espionage activities," it said.
shaheen condemned the detentions and accusations, and asked
  tehran to free all fishing boats and sailors held by iran, the
  statement said.
uae trade, current account surpluses narrow
  the united arab emirates (uae) recorded
  a 1986 trade surplus of 12.2 billion dirhams, narrowing from
  30.2 billion in 1985, the central bank's latest bulletin shows.
the central bank said the lower surplus was mainly due to
  the decline in the value of exports and reexports to 37.2
  billion dirhams from 54.2 billion in 1985.
this reflected the
  decline in oil prices last year and difficulties in marketing
  uae oil, the central bank added.
the surplus on the current account narrowed to 6.8 billion
  dirhams from 25.5 billion in 1985.
the overall balance showed a
  surplus of 4.8 billion after 2.6 billion in 1985.
bp cuts north sea propane price, butane unchanged
  british petroleum lp gas international
  said it cut its north sea lpg (liquified petroleum gas) posted
  price for propane to 95 dlrs from 110 dlrs a tonne, effective
  june 1.
the move follows a similar cut to 92 from 108 dlrs a tonne
  announced by shell u.k. ltd friday, also fob north sea
  terminals and effective june 1 until further notice.
both
  companies left their butane prices unchanged at 123 dlrs a
  tonne.
a bp statement said its cut came "as a result of a price
  review occasioned by substantial changes in the lpg market."
bp
  last lowered its posted propane price from 175 dlrs a tonne on
  march 1, and shell u.k.'s last change was from 113 dlrs may 1.
saudi arabia will not agree "mad" oil price rise
  saudi arabia's oil minister hisham nazer
  said riyadh would not agree to a cut in oil prices and would
  not accept a "mad" increase that would drive consumers away.
he told al-riyadh newspaper, "saudi arabia follows a
  balanced petroleum policy.
it does not approve of a decrease in
  prices from current levels and it also does not accept a mad
  increase that would drive consumers away and make them try and
  find alternative sources (for energy)."
opec agreed last december to cut production after world
  prices hit new lows in 1986.
they agreed on a pricing system
  aimed to stabilise the market around 18 dlrs a barrel.
opec is scheduled to meet in vienna on june 25, where it
  will review its current oil price and production policy.
saudi arabia's king fahd said last month that he wanted oil
  prices to remain stable for the next two years.
saudi arabia is the architect of the current pricing and
  production pact, which is backed by kuwait and the uae.
the
  current pact set a production ceiling for first half 1987 of
  15.8 mln bpd, and implemented fixed prices based on an 18 dlrs
  a barrel average.
taiwan curbs inflows of foreign exchange
  taiwan's central bank announced that as
  from today the overseas foreign exchange borrowings of local
  and foreign banks would be frozen at the level they reached at
  the end of may.
the central bank's statement added that the measure would
  be effective until the end of july.
bankers said the measure is designed to curb the inflow of
  foreign exchange and slow the growth of money supply.
they
  added that the move, which sparked a record single day plunge
  of the local stock market, would limit their ability to lend
  foreign exchange to importers and exporters.
foreign exchange borrowings by local and foreign banks
  reached almost 12 billion u.s. dlrs by the end of april,
  according to official statistics.
last week the central bank said that from today it would
  reduce its purchase of forward u.s.
dollars from banks to 40
  pct from 90 pct of the value of the contract.
it said the move
  was needed because of "distortions" in the foreign exchange
  market.
exporters, nervous about the appreciating taiwan dollar,
  have been heavily selling forward u.s.
dollars on the interbank
  market to avoid exchange rate losses.
official figures show that forward u.s. dollar sales in may
  reached a record of almost six billion u.s. dlrs against 5.9
  billion in april.
all taiwan's foreign exchange earnings must be converted
  into local dollars, boosting money supply at a time of booming
  exports.
money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.86 pct in
  the year to end-april, raising fears of higher inflation.
in march the central bank clamped tight restrictions on
  remittances of foreign exchange by companies and individuals to
  taiwan in a move to curb inflows of speculative money.
economists and bankers estimate that the rising value of
  the local dollar has attracted about ten billion u.s. dlrs of
  speculative money into taiwan since early last year.
it has
  flowed in mainly from hong kong, japan and the u.s..
since september 1985 the taiwan dollar has risen by about
  22 pct against the u.s. dollar.
bankers said the government's efforts to stabilise the
  foreign exchange market were a prelude to lifting all curbs on
  capital outflows.
the central bank has said the controls will
  be dropped by the end of july or early august.
foreign exchange dealers said today's announcement caused
  jitters in the market with foreign and local banks making heavy
  purchases of u.s.
dollars.
they said the central bank sold
  about 30 mln u.s. dlrs.
taiwan's stock market plunged a record 75.53 points to
  close at 1,803.08.
u.k. reserves rise underlying 4.8 billion dlrs in may, (2.9 billion april) - official

  u.k. reserves rise underlying 4.8 billion dlrs in may, (2.9 billion april) - official
u.k. reserves show record underlying rise in may
  britain's gold and currency reserves rose
  a record underlying 4.76 billion dlrs in may, following april's
  2.9 billion dlrs increase, the treasury said.
the underlying trend indicates the level of recent bank of
  england intervention on currency markets to curb sterling's
  strength.
it was above market expectations which had been for a
  rise of between one billion and three billion dlrs.
the treasury declined comment on the figures.
actual reserves rose 4.87 billion dlrs in may, compared
  with april's 2.8 billion increase, to a total value of 34.68
  billion dlrs, compared with 29.81 billion at the end of april.
borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 238 mln
  dlrs, against april's 66 mln.
repayments under the scheme were
  85 mln dlrs, after 90 mln previously, with capital repayments
  of eight mln, after three mln last month.
repayments of government debt amounted to 33 mln dlrs.
the underlying reserves increase is net of borrowings and
  repayments.
it was larger than the previous record 3.04 billion dlrs
  rise seen in october 1977.
the may increase represents the
  seventh monthly rise, with reserves up 9.947 billion dlrs in
  that period, and up 9.816 billion since the start of 1987.
nakasone, sumita agree discount rate cut not appropriate now - central bank sources

  nakasone, sumita agree discount rate cut not appropriate now - central bank sources
nakasone, sumita agree rate cut not appropriate
  prime minister yasuhiro nakasone today
  agreed with bank of japan governor satoshi sumita that a
  further cut in the discount rate was not appropriate at
  present, central bank sources said.
they told reuters the two discussed the subject at a
  routine meeting.
sumita told nakasone he did not feel a rate cut was
  appropriate and nakasone expressed his understanding, the
  sources said.
currency dealers have speculated that japan and west
  germany might come under pressure at next week's venice summit
  to cut interest rates to boost their economies.
nakasone, but not sumita, is due to attend the summit.
japan concerned at ec trade threats - minister
  japan is disappointed at the recent threats
  of trade retaliation from the european community (ec) just as
  the trade situation between the two is improving, japanese
  trade and industry minister hajime tamura said.
"i am deeply concerned that the ec has moved to take a
  harsher line toward japan despite this tangible improvement," he
  said in a speech prepared for delivery at the opening of a new
  centre designed to improve understanding between the two sides.
last week, foreign ministers of the 12 ec nations agreed to
  impose tariffs on a range of unspecified japanese electrical
  goods unless tokyo opened its markets more to ec exports.
tamura referred to a 55 pct rise in japanese imports of ec
  manufactured goods in the year ended march 31.
"i feel this is a strong step on the road to balance through
  expansion."
"while i do not deny the existence of the trade deficit
  between japan and the ec, i believe it should be rectified not
  by reducing trade through import restrictions or export
  restraints, but by expanding the (overall) trade," tamura said.
glynwed buys gallaher units for around 14 mln stg
  glynwed international plc &lt;glyn.l> said it
  had bought all the issued shares of two companies belonging to
  gallaher ltd, a subsidiary of american brands inc &lt;amb>, in a
  deal worth around 14 mln stg.
the full names of the companies purchased from gallaher are
  &lt;formatura iniezione polimeri spa>, genoa and &lt;fip u.k. ltd>,
  weybridge.
consideration for the purchases, which will be based on the
  net asset values per share of the companies, has yet to be
  finalised but some nine mln stg of the total represents debt
  assumed by glynwed.
fip is a manufacturer of valves and other pressure pipe
  fittings in thermoplastics.
its products are complementary to
  those of glynwed subsidiaries, durapipe u.k. and philmac.
the acquisitions appreciably develop and strengthen
  glynwed's strategic position in the thermoplastic pipework
  systems market.
the sale by gallaher reflects a decision to dispose of more
  peripheral businesses.
proceeds of the sale will be used in the
  continuing expansion of the gallaher group.
glynwed shares were
  up 5p to 494 after the announcement.
gallaher is not quoted on
  the london stock exchange.
kuwaiti dinar rates firm, aid window open
  interest rates on kuwaiti dinar deposits
  held firm in scattered trading despite a central bank decision
  to revive limited funding lines, dealers said.
the central bank, which last tuesday shut a daily aid
  window through which it lent funds of up to one year, reopened
  the facility for three month money, which was available at
  seven pct, they said.
it offered one month funds at seven pct through swap
  facilities, dealers said.
today's central bank action, combined with sales of dollars
  by some banks, helped ease a recent credit squeeze engineered
  by the monetary authority to stem a rush for the u.s. currency
  arising from attractive u.s. interest rates and gulf tension,
  dealers said.
however, as one dealer noted: "the market is still
  unsettled."
overnight funds, bid at 20 pct at the outset of business,
  traded up to 30 pct before easing as liquidity dragged offers
  down to 10 pct by the close.
tomorrow-next, for which buy/sell
  quotes started at 30, 20 pct, ended at 14, eight.
spot-next was indicated at 8-1/2, seven after opening bids
  of 10.
dealers quoted one-week at eight, seven against an early
  9-1/2, 7-1/2.
one month rates were at the same level after trade at eight
  then 8-1/2.
dealers quoted three months at seven, 6-3/4 pct and
  six-month to one year funds at seven, six pct.
they reported
  offshore offers of overnight at 10, tomorrow-next at eight and
  one year at 6-1/2 pct towards the close.
the central bank fixed its dinar exchange rate steady at
  0.27933/67 to the dollar, against yesterday's 0.27939/73.
the
  spot dinar was 0.27930/40.

  per share tender offer for all shares of argosystems inc that
  it announced yesterday morning.
in a newspaper advertisement, the company said the offer,

if at least 90 pct of
  argosystems' shares are tendered, it said it will buy all
  shares, but if less than 90 pct are tendered, it said it plans
  to buy only 49 pct in the offer.
boeing said if less than 90 pct of argosystems' shares are
  tendered, but the purchase of all shares tendered along with
  the exercise of options it holds would give it over 90 pct of
  argosystems, boeing may buy all shares tendered.
argosystems has granted boeing an option to buy up to
  1,238,311 new shares or a 15.6 pct interest at 37 dlrs each,

bomb threats, strikes as fiji sees end trade ban
  fiji today welcomed the ending of a trade
  ban imposed by australian labor unions as supporters of the
  country's ousted prime minister timoci bavadra renewed pressure
  for his reinstatement with strikes and shop closures.
the government welcomed a decision by the australian
  waterside workers' federation to lift its ban on shipments to
  fiji, imposed in support of bavadra, whose newly-elected
  government was overthrown in a military coup on may 14.
the ban had threatened food shortages of imported wheat,
  fresh vegetables and medicines.
a direct result of the union
  decision would be the immediate shipment of 9,000 tons of rice
  and wheat from an australian port, the government said.
shops in nadi and lautoka, center of the country's sugar
  industry, closed again today in support of bavadra.
in nadi two bomb threats forced evacuation of the
  australian westpac bank, but police said they turned out to be
  a hoax.
bavadra has launched a campaign of civil disobedience
  to press for his reinstatement.

u.k. reserves lift hopes of further base rate cut
  the record 4.9 billion dlrs rise in u.k.
  reserves in may to a total 34.7 billion has lifted hopes for a
  further cut in bank base lending rates after the june 11
  general election, market analysts said.
sterling would have risen on the much better than expected
  number but for market nerves about the poll outcome, they said.
but the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves now
  available to the authorities to support the pound should curb
  any market tendency to panic if u.k. opinion polls show the
  ruling conservative party's lead slipping, they added.
"we have been intervening to a very much greater extent than
  we have done hitherto," chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson
  said at a news conference today, commenting on the news of the
  record reserves rise.
he put the u.k.
intervention in the context of the louvre
  accord between leading industrial nations to stabilise the
  dollar, partly through direct intervention on foreign
  exchanges.
"we have been playing a very full part ourselves," he
  said.
but market analysts see the recent upward pressure on
  sterling, and consequent need for official sales to damp down
  its rise, more in the light of local factors.
steven bell, chief economist at morgan grenfell securities,
  said that corporate money has been flowing back into britain
  amid hopes of another conservative government, after fears last
  autumn of a labour election victory sent it flooding out.
u.k.
portfolio investment is also returning, while foreign
  buyers see u.k. growth propects and high bond yields as
  attractive.
they will be strong buyers of u.k. assets, notably
  equities, once the election is out of the way, bell said.
analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lower
  interest rates, as the government is expected to try to reverse
  the loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound.
today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reserves
  news, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket of
  currencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 gmt to 73.0
  pct at 1100 gmt, half an hour after the figures were released.
"the market doesn't want to do anything because of the
  election," commented an economist at a big u.s. investment bank.
several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts of
  a rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs had
  overestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely to
  have been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on the
  forward market.
the market also seemed to have overestimated the amount of
  sterling the bank of england bought at the end of may to smooth
  the pound's sudden downturn, while some of the intervention
  reported in may probably occurred in april, they said.
the key three months interbank money market rates eased
  about 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrend
  in u.k. interest rates will be revived following the reserves
  news, analysts said.
government bond prices initially firmed, but the market was
  muted as traders worried about the funding implications of
  another huge rise in reserves, they added.
morgan grenfell's bell forecast a half point base rate cut
  from the current nine pct level soon after the election, so
  long as poll projections of another conservative victory prove
  accurate, with another half point later.
justin silverton, equity economist at credit suisse
  buckmaster and moore, said a full point reduction might be
  possible.
"sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts in
  future, rather than this active intervention," he predicted.
kevin boakes of greenwell montagu gilt-edged cautioned
  against over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cut
  looked likely.
a cut before the election has been virtually ruled out.
"the bank (of england) is both worried about the political
  problem of cutting rates during an election campaign ... and
  has signalled some worry about broad money (growth)," said robin
  marshall, chief u.k.
economist at chase manhattan securities.
he said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves in
  the past seven months may foreshadow full u.k.
entry into the
  european monetary system.
but bell said the authorities would like to see another 10
  or 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining, if they did
  so.
but, unlike many analysts, he doubted the u.k. will go in.

s.africa expected to unveil expansionary budget
  south africa is expected to unveil
  tomorrow an expansionary budget for the second consecutive year
  in a bid to boost the nation's flagging economic growth rate,
  economic analysts said.
faced with competing demands for increased military and
  police spending and the pressing need for more funds for black
  housing and education, finance minister barend du plessis is
  expected to raise significantly the government's overall
  expenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament,
  the analysts said.
analysts expect du plessis to provide for a rise in state
  spending at least equal to the 16 pct inflation rate for the
  financial year that started on april 1, while ignoring pleas
  from the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes.
"fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary, but
  simply raising government spending and increasing the budget
  deficit is an inflationary form of stimulation," said rob lee,
  chief economist at south african mutual life assurance co.
      south africa this year is targeting inflation-adjusted
  growth in gdp of three pct against an increase last year of
  less than one pct.
growth in gdp over the past decade has averaged about 1.5
  pct, while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled to
  over 30 pct.
economists estimate that the government's spending target
  will rise to about 47 billion rand, with revenue budgeted at
  around 40 billion rand.
this would leave a budget deficit
  before borrowing of about seven billion rand, or four pct of
  gdp.
the government, having consistently overshot its own
  spending targets for more than a decade, also faces a
  credibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the
  budget, analysts said.
"the budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure,"
  said standard bank ltd in a budget preview.
many analysts in the private sector are now paying less
  attention to the figures presented in the budget and are using
  their own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the
  money and capital markets.
south african mutual's lee believes government spending
  will again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49
  billion rand this year, leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5
  pct of gdp, compared with a three pct limit suggested by the
  imf.
"the imf limit is obviously going to be abandoned," predicted
  one analyst, noting that south africa has moved steadily away
  from austerity measures recommended by the imf over the past
  two years.
the policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in the
  political situation and the onset of an economic crisis
  triggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over
  loans to the country in september 1985.
against a background of western economic sanctions, falling
  per capita incomes, rising joblessness and high inflation,
  government officials say economic growth is the prime
  objective.
but private-sector economists caution that the government's
  ability to promote growth by boosting state spending is
  constrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on the
  current account of the country's balance of payments.
most of that surplus, this year estimated at around 2.5
  billion dlrs, will be swallowed up by repayments on the
  nation's estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an
  arrangement reached earlier this year with major international
  creditor banks.
within these constraints, economists believe du plessis has
  little room to manoeuvre.
analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and
  budgeted spending increases for the state-owned post office and
  south african transport services suggest that major tax
  concessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely.
du plessis earlier this year announced small concessions
  for taxpayers in a mini-budget before the may 6 whites-only
  election.
the poll delayed presentation of the national budget.
"this will not be a very exciting budget," commented harry
  schwarz, spokesman on finance for the liberal progressive
  federal party.
"i do not expect any major tax cuts as all the
  sweets were given out before the election."

colombo to defend waters, india readies flotilla
  sri lanka today ordered its armed forces
  to defend the island's territorial waters as india prepared to
  send a flotilla with relief supplies that colombo says it does
  not want for the tamils in the jaffna peninsula.
the sudden crisis between sri lanka and its giant neighbour
  deepened as prime minister ranasinghe premadasa told
  parliament: "we have our territorial limits and nobody can be
  allowed to trespass there ...
      "president (junius) jayewardene has ordered the army, navy
  and air force to protect the island and its territorial waters,"
  premadasa said to a round of applause from the house.
in new delhi an indian spokesman said the plan to send a
  flotilla of 20 small unarmed boats with red cross supplies to
  jaffna tomorrow would go ahead despite colombo's objections.
the confrontation was the latest result of the long and
  bitter conflict between sri lanka's buddhist sinhalese majority
  and the hindu tamil minority, which has strong ethnic and
  cultural links with india's 50 mln tamils.
lawson says louvre currency accord satisfactory
  the louvre agreement by the group of seven
  finance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencies
  has worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at the
  economic summit in venice on june 8-10, u.k. chancellor of the
  exchequer nigel lawson said.
previewing the summit, which he expected would not produce
  any major new economic initiatives, lawson told reporters work
  remained to be done on improving the conditions for lasting
  world economic growth.üside measures to boost growth, he said.
"i think it is possible that there may be scope for a
  further reduction in interest rates in germany," he added, but
  stressed that he had had no indication that such a move was
  likely.
he made no mention of japanese interest rates.
lawson said the u.s. should embark on "a gradual reduction
  of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years."
he said the february 22 louvre accord had produced
  "satisfactory exchange rate stability," in part thanks to heavy
  coordinated intervention of group of seven central banks, and
  he was "content" with sterling's exchange rate.
pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in u.k. may
  currency reserves announced today he said, "we have been playing
  a very full part ourselves ... we have been intervening to a
  very much greater extent than we had done hitherto."
lawson said there was a risk that the louvre agreement may
  falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic
  commitments underlying the accord.
"certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange
  rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their
  commitments in paris ...
in this respect."
he said the u.s.
  budget deficit was "very important."
noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by
  japanese prime minister yasuhiro nakasone last week lawson
  said, "what is really needed in japan is an increase in
  merchandise imports.
supply side measures are critical."
"there is a specific range of consumer and agricultural
  goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is
  wholly unjustified," he said.
lawson doubted that tokyo's partners would indulge in "japan
  bashing" at the summit especially after the economic stimulation
  package and the announcement of nakasone's plans to increase
  japanese development aid over the next three years.
japan's more flexible stance on tokyo stock exchange
  membership would also help deflect criticism, he said.
he said he thought west germany would instead come under
  pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to
  jack up faltering economic growth.
in this respect lawson said he hoped bonn would bring
  forward to january 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts
  scheduled for 1990.
he also called on bonn to push ahead with
  the privatisation of german national industries.
on debt, lawson said he expected a three point british plan
  to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to
  make progress in venice.
the plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign
  debt in the paris club, was first proposed at the imf and world
  bank meetings in washington earlier this year.
lawson said he would seek "to consolidate political backing
  for the plan at the venice summit" and hoped the programme would
  be finalised at the autumn meetings of the imf and world bank.
he welcomed the recent moves by citicorp and chase
  manhattan to increase sharply their third world debt
  provisions.
"first, it is a blow for realism.
second, because the market
  response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this
  sort of move than they felt before citicorp," he said.
u.k. banks should follow bank of england recommendations,
  strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions.
"they have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,"
  lawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves to
  determine the appropriate size of provisions.
he also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be
  discussed at the summit.
"there is a consensus, which we have to
  push further."

  and 31.6 pct by berisford, would have annual sales in 1987 of
  over 700 mln dlrs.
grace said the transaction involves the combination of its
  cocoa products division and two berisford cocoa processing
  units, which would be operated under grace management.
the company said berisford would contribute its dutch and
  west german cocoa subsidiaries and issue new ordinary shares to
  grace in connection with the transaction.

csr says it is proceeding with offer for monier
  csr ltd &lt;csra.s> intends to proceed with
  its planned bid for building materials group monier ltd
  &lt;mnra.s> despite the counter-bid from &lt;equiticorp tasman ltd>
  (etl), csr executive director gene herbert told reuters.
etl said today it would offer 4.15 dlrs each for monier's
  issued capital of 156.28 mln shares, plus a share alternative.
this compares with a 3.80 dlr cash element in csr's proposed
  bid.
the proposed offer by etl, controlled by new zealand
  entrepreneur allan hawkins, came after it built up a 14.99 pct
  stake in monier in a 95 mln dlr share raid in recent days.
herbert said britain's redland plc &lt;rdld.l>, which holds
  just under 50 pct of monier, still supported the csr bid and
  had told csr it is not a seller.
he said redland wanted to maintain and build on its
  operations in australia and the u.s., where monier has built up
  a strong presence, notably in roofing tile manufacture.
the csr offer contains a put and call option agreement with
  redland.
this enables redland to accept the csr bid within six
  months of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in the
  same period and to run monier as a joint venture with csr.
csr has said that redland will take up the second option.
etl has declined to say why it intervened in monier, beyond
  describing it as a long term investment.
etl would bring no synergies to monier, unlike csr which is
  a leader in building materials, herbert said.
"we fit better with monier," he said.
csr has said that it will concentrate development on its
  core businesses of sugar and building materials after its moves
  into energy several years ago.
asked what he thought etl's bid sought to achieve, herbert
  said: "i'm puzzled as to what hawkins' strategy is.
one has to
  wonder if monier is the main target."
herbert said csr had no plans to raise its bid, and said a
  higher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals.
monier was trading at 2.80 dlrs when csr launched its
  original bid of 3.50, or 16.8 times earnings, in late april.
the shares closed at 3.90 dlrs today, down 25 cents on
  yesterday, after etl withdrew on reaching the top foreign
  shareholding level permitted without foreign investment review
  board (firb) approval.
its bid is subject to firb approval.
herbert also said that institutions, which are more likely
  to accept a share alternative than cash, would have to judge
  the respective values of etl and csr shares.
etl is the third group to become involved in a possible
  acquisition of monier this year.
redland held discussions on a
  possible takeover before the csr bid emerged but the
  negotiations foundered on the price.
share analysts said that for this reason, they did not
  think etl's intervention would flush out a full redland bid
  although monier's ultimate fate rests in its hands.
"redland is still in the driving seat," said tim cohen of
  &lt;ord minnett ltd>, adding that redland would be happier having
  csr as a partner in running monier than etl.
monier's independent directors have recommended etl's bid.

montrose holding to acquire virginia federal
  &lt;virginia federal savings and loan
  association> said it has signed a definitive agreement to be
  acquired by &lt;montrose holding co>, an affiliate of &lt;montrose

virginia federal and montrose capital said the agreement
  provides for the conversion of virginia federal from a mutual
  to a stock association and the purchase of 100 pct of its stock
  for 20 mln dlrs by montrose.
according to the companies, virginia federal has over 700
  mln dlrs in assets and operates 16 branches in virginia.
virginia federal said the proceeds would enable it to
  provide increased mortgage and lending services and enable the
  company to compete more effectively in the virginia market.
the companies said the agreement is subject to federal home
  loan bank board approval, expected later this year.
additionally, the companies said the converted association
  would be managed by a board of directors consisting of the six
  current virginia federal directors and two representatives of
  montrose holding.
the senior management of virginia federal was expected to
  continue in office after the conversion, the companies said.
brazil's sarney renews call for war on inflation
  president jose sarney today declared "a
  war without quarter" on inflation and said the government would
  watch every cent of public expenditure.
sarney, addressing his cabinet live on television, also
  reiterated that he intended to remain in power for five years,
  until 1990.
there has been a long-running political debate
  about how long his mandate should be.
brazil is currently suffering from the worst inflation of
  its history.
in april monthly inflation reached 21 pct.
pakistan says good economic growth continues
  pakistan says its economy has continued
  its recent outstanding performance during the financial year
  1986/87 ending on june 30 but areas like balance of payments,
  investments and energy were causing concern.
gdp grew in line with the average growth rate since 1980
  and the inflation rate was the lowest since 1969/70, according
  to a government economic survey.
the reform of economic regulation had gathered momentum
  and there was an impressive performance in a five point
  government program for rural uplift, education and poverty
  alleviation, said the survey.
ministry economic adviser qazi alimullah told a news
  conference that before recent unseasonal rains and hailstorms
  damaged the wheat crop, gdp growth was calculated at 7.04 pct
  compared to 7.25 pct in 1985/86.he said the figure might now
  slide down a little to around 6.8 or 6.9 pct.
the survey said monetary expansion was estimated to be nine
  pct to date but might rise to around 12 pct by the year-end.
alimullah said exports rose 18 pct to 3.5 billion dlrs from
  2.9 billion dlrs in 1985/86.
but the at the same time, home
  remittances by pakistanis abroad dropped to 2.3 billion dlrs
  from the 1985/86 level of 2.595 billion.
more exports and an improvement in the balance of payments
  situation will be required to overcome this declining trend in
  home remittances, he said.
the survey said the trade deficit was expected to fall to
  2.4 billion dlrs from three billion dlrs in 1985/86 because of
  the boost in exports.
he said national investment continued to be small because
  of a poor rate of savings, about 14 pct of gdp.
he said more
  savings were required to maintain or possibly step up the
  present growth rate and to finance the country's seventh
  five-year development plan to be launched in july 1988.

acme precision &lt;acl> buyout bid dropped
  acme precision products inc said a
  management group has withdrawn a six dlr per share leveraged
  buyout offer.
acme said the management group dropped its bid due to
  continued weakness in the machine tool industry and in acme
  precision's operating results and to the inability of the
  management group to obtain modifications to terms of its
  financing commitment.
it said, "the effect of these factors led the management
  group to conclude that the six dlr per share price was
  excessive under current conditions."
italian barley crop reported in good condition
  italy's barley crop is generally in good
  condition and harvesting is expected to begin shortly, the
  agricultural marketing information and research board irvam
  said.
first consignments were expected to be available around
  mid-june.
excellent weather, characterised by alternating periods of
  sunshine and rain, has encouraged growth except in sardinia,
  which was expected to lose a large part of its barley crop
  because of extreme dryness.
irvam said yields are expected higher than last year's low
  levels if favourable weather continues in the next few weeks.
given an average yield of 3.5 tonnes per hectare, national
  production would be around two pct higher than in the previous
  season at just above 1.6 mln tonnes, it said.
if yields reach the record 3.78 tonnes per hectare achieved
  in 1984, production would be around 1.75 mln tonnes, an
  increase of 11 pct compared to 1986.

chicken not main salmonella cause, official says
  a representative of the poultry
  industry said statistics showed that chicken is less frequently
  the cause of salmonella poisoning than beef, dairy products or
  salads and other mixed foods.
kenneth may, president of holly farms poultry industries
  and a director of the national broiler council, told a house
  agriculture subcommittee the incidence of salmonella in chicken
  has not increased in recent years and that chicken is neither
  the major source of the bacterial poisoning nor the cause of an
  increase in outbreaks of the disease.
may said the center for disease control figures showed that
  between 1978 and 1982, chicken was involved in four pct of all
  u.s. salmonellosis outbreaks, while beef accounted for ten pct
  of outbreaks and dairy products six pct.
may said the remaining outbreaks were caused by salads and
  mixed food, turkey, seafood, pork, eggs and other foods.
may said the chicken industry favored moving away from
  bird-by-bird inspection procedures to a risk assessment system
  better able to identify microbial and bacterial contamination
  of poultry.
however, ellen haas, executive director of public voice for
  food and health policy, said bird-by-bird inspection should be
  retained and labels should be attached to each ready-to-cook
  chicken to remind consumers about preparation procedures
  necessary to avoid illness.
haas also called for a review of present chicken industry
  inspection methods that she said can worsen poultry hazards.
u.s. house panel votes to speed up corn payments
  the house agriculture committee voted
  to make approximately 2.8 billion dlrs of feedgrains deficiency
  payments immediately instead of in the late fall.
a similar measure was decisively defeated on the senate
  floor last week.
the bill, which passed by a voice vote, would allow
  so-called findley payments to be made immediately rather than
  late this year.
payments for 1987-90 feedgrains crops would not
  be changed.
because the bill would move 2.8 billion dlrs of spending
  into fiscal 1987 from fiscal 1988, the measure is expected to
  meet stiff resistance in the full house.

lawson calls intervention proof of stability goal
  the scale of foreign exchange intervention
  the bank of england has carried out recently is clear proof of
  britain's determination to stabilise exchange rates as agreed
  between the group of seven industrialised countries in paris in
  february, chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson said.
saying he was "content" with sterling's current value, lawson
  told reporters he wanted "to maintain the exchange rate
  stability we have all signed up for."
he declined to say if he
  favoured a rise or a fall from present sterling levels.
may currency reserves, out today, showed a record 4.8 billion
  stg rise, pointing to massive currency intervention.
in april, reserves rose a hefty 2.9 billion stg.
pointing to the reserves data, lawson said, "we have been
  playing a very full part ourselves" in meeting our commitments
  toward exchange rate stability as agreed in paris.
"we wish to see it (stability) continuing," he added.
asked which techniques were available to preserve
  stability, lawson said both central bank intervention and
  interest rate changes could be used to tackle "the market
  pressures there are from time to time."
"interest rate stability is not an objective in that
  sense...rates have to be moved up and down at times," he added.
lawson said he expected intervention to be "sterilised" by
  draining excess sterling liquidity from the market through new
  issues of government securities and foreign currency sales,
  when the market allowed.
this would limit the inflationary impact of intervention,
  he said.
"sterilisation will be dictated by market tactics...not
  necessarily in the month in which intervention occurs," lawson
  said.
"i am confident that we can sterilise on this scale."

u.s. energy secretary sees higher oil prices
  energy secretary donald hodel said he
  expects oil prices to rise significantly by the year 2000,
  probably to around 33 dlrs a barrel in current dollars.
"i do anticipate a significant increase (by 2000).
thirty-three dlrs a barrel is not unreasonable," hodel told the
  senate energy committee.
hodel said the loss of some domestic oil production through
  the shutdown of stripper (10 barrels a day or less) wells
  because of low prices was probably permanent.
he said he was
  also concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration.
hodel urged congress to approve oil exploration in section
  1002 of the arctic national wildlife refuge in alaska.

judge to decide burlington &lt;bur> in several days
  u.s. district court judge eugene
  a. gordon said he will decide "in the next few days" whether to
  grant burlington industries inc's request to stop a takeover by
  samjens acquisition corp.
      "i do not know how i come down on this preliminary
  injunction," gordon said after listening to arguments by
  attorneys for 1-1/2 days.
"it's been a long time since i was deluged with as much
  information as i have been.
i have to consider what's been
  presented and issue an opinion on this.
both sides cannot be
  winners," he said.
burlington requested the injunction to stop a takeover
  effort by samjens, claiming the partnership used illegally
  obtained confidential information about the company to make its
  offer.
it also alleges there would be anti-trust violations if
  samjens, formed by asher edelman and dominion textiles inc of
  canada, were to succeed.
samjens last week topped a 76 dlr per share offer for
  burlington from morgan stanley group &lt;ms> by one dlr per share.
morgan stanley made its 2.44 billion dlr bid after samjens bid
  72 dlrs per share for burlington.
burlington lawyers told the court if the injunction is not
  granted samjens would win control of burlington.
a samjens
  lawyer argued that if the judge granted the injunction it would
  "kill the offer"
      jay greenfield, an attorney for samjens, said the
  partnership would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction
  were granted.
"there's only one burlington," he said.
"if we
  cannot get that then no amount of money can compensate us."
greenfield also said samjens could sell its holdings in
  burlington for 95 mln dlrs.
"we don't want that.
we're not in
  this for the money," he said.
irving nathan, a burlington lawyer, reiterated that
  information provided by james ammeen, a former burlington
  executive, was crucial to dominion's decision to attempt o
  takeover of burlington.
"dominion relied on the information provided by the insider
  jim ammeen," nathan said.
an attorney for ammeen, who is named as a defendant, asked
  the court to dismiss the lawsuit against his client.
the judge
  said he would not rule on the request today.
allegis &lt;aeg> to sell canadian hotels
  allegis corp said it has created a
  limited partnership to sell selected hotels in canada to the
  public.
it said the offering is expected to raise in excess of 350
  mln canadian dlrs and will be completed by the end of
  september.
the limited partnership will be similar to the westin
  hotels limited partnership completed last year when allegis
  sold westin hotels in san francisco and chicago.
allegis
  reported a pretax gain of 80.6 mln dlrs as a result of that
  partnership.
an allegis spokesman said the offerings have been in
  planning stages for a long time and are unrelated to recent
  corporate developments such as the firm's recapitalization plan
  and a threatened takeover by an investor group lead by coniston
  partners and the pilots of its united airlines unit.
the spokesman said the company has not yet identified which
  of its canadian hotels will be offered for sale.
allegis has 100 pct ownership in westin hotels in
  vancouver, calgary, ottawa and toronto, and 100 pct interest in
  hilton international hotels in toronto and montreal.
it owns 60
  pct of the westin in edmonton.
richard ferris, chairman of allegis, said in a statement
  the hotel limited partnerships allow the company to convert
  unrecognized asset appreciation into cash.
as with the proceeds from the earlier limited partnership,
  the money will be used for general corporate needs, the
  spokesman said.
merrill lynch capital markets and wood gundy will be lead
  underwriters for to the public offering.
the limited
  partnership will be offered outside the u.s, allegis said.
raycomm transworld &lt;racm.o> to make acquisition
  raycomm transworld industries inc
  said it has agreed in principle subject to board approvals to
  acquire spiridellis consulting group inc, a privately-held
  computer services consulting firm, for a number of common
  shares to be determined based on pretax earnings of spiridellis
  over a five-year period.
the company said it will gaurantee that almost all of the
  issued shares will attain price levels ranging from five to
  nine dlrs each for two years after their issuance.
it said spiridellis had revenues of 3,500,000 dlrs in
  calendar 1986.
3m &lt;mmm> acquires control data &lt;cda> unit
  minnesota mining and manufacturing
  said it acquired a computerized hospital information systems
  business from control data corp.
terms were not disclosed.
the business, which has 145 employees and supplies
  computers and software for hospital information systems, will
  be integrated into 3m's hospital software business.
control data said the divestiture was part of its strategy
  to focus on narrower markets.
lukman sees stable oil price for next couple years
  the current crude oil price of between
  18 and 20 dlrs a barrel will remain stable over the next couple
  of years, rising only one to two dlrs a barrel per annum to
  keep up with inflation, opec president rilwanu lukman said.
lukman, who was speaking during talks with swedish trade
  officials, said the stable price depended upon output restraint
  by both opec and non-opec oil producers, swedish government
  officials said.
they said lukman, who is also nigerian oil minister, made
  the remarks whilst talking about the connection between third
  world debt and industrialised nations.
crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higher
  energy bills for the world's industrial nations, lukman said.
although very low oil prices, such as those seen around the
  beginning of the year, may appear beneficial for the industrial
  countries that depend on imported energy, they would only lead
  to wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, he
  said.
this in turn would bring a swing back to extremely high
  prices, he added.
sweden, heavily dependent on imported oil, suffered a major
  crisis in the mid-1970s, when oil prices spiralled.
bundesbank credit policy changes unlikely
  the bundesbank is unlikely to change
  credit policies when its central bank council meets on thursday
  for its last session before the venice summit, banking
  economists and money market dealers said.
the bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month
  by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and is
  unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates
  in the near future, they said.
the council will meet in saarbruecken, and the meeting will
  be followed by a news conference at around 1030 gmt.
but bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was
  usually called when the council meets outside frankfurt, and
  did not necessarily herald any policy moves.
bundesbank vice-president helmut schlesinger said today
  there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply
  growth had shown no signs of slowing in may and the dollar was
  stable against the mark.
schlesinger told reuters in tokyo, where the bundesbank has
  opened a representative office, that the west german economy
  was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted
  1/2 to one pct in the first quarter.
money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in
  a 3.50/70 pct range for most of this month, after the
  bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a
  minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct.
"they have set this signal and indicated they could maybe
  lower market rates even further, but not with the discount or
  lombard," winfried hutmann, chief economist of schroeder,
  munchmeyer, hengst investment gmbh said.
werner chrobok, managing partner at bethmann bank, said
  german rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and
  around historical lows for west germany.
a further cut in rates would have little impact on the
  economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand,
  with companies swimming in liquidity, chrobok said.
the bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move
  on interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve.
"the bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder," he said.
a cut in the discount or lombard rates, to bring them in
  line with the new structure of money market rates since last
  month, would have little practical significance, dealers said.
the bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a
  diplomatic gesture before next week's venice summit.
but bundesbank president karl otto poehl has often made it
  clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere "eyewash."
economists said it was really up to the bonn government to
  cut taxes, rather than for the bundesbank to ease monetary
  policy, to meet pressure on west germany at the venice summit.
but with bonn struggling to finance already announced tax
  cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget
  deficit, it is hard to see how bonn could cut taxes further.
"the bonn government will be in a very weak position in
  venice because they can't risk increasing the deficit further,"
  said schroeder, muenchmeyer, hengst's hutmann.
bethmann's chrobok said if anything is to happen before
  venice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy.
"but i
  don't expect any convincing measures," he said.
money market dealers noted that call money continued to
  normalize today, falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterday
  and as much as five pct on friday when it was pushed up by
  month-end distortions.
call money could come under upwards pressure later this
  month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on
  behalf of customers, starting in the week beginning june 15.
two public holidays that week could also distort the market.
dealers said they expected the bundesbank to allocate funds
  tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55
  pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct,
  and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact.
but dealers said it was possible the bundesbank would
  allocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55.
that would not
  represent a tightening of policy, however.
because the bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates
  at the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a full
  allocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said.
on another issue, poehl has said the bundesbank is likely
  to lift restrictions on private use of the european currency
  unit (ecu) at one of its meetings soon.
saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement
  on this gesture to european unity, as it is the capital of the
  saarland bordering france, and was twice under french
  occupation this century.
but dealers said an ecu announcement was unlikely to come
  this week, as a number of technical and legal matters had still
  to be resolved, for instance how german ecu accounts would be
  treated for minimum reserve purposes.
alcan reduces cost of planned smelter
  alcan aluminium ltd said it has cut the
  expected cost of its planned laterriere, quebec, smelter by
  using enhanced grande baie reduction technology.
the company said the decision to use prebaked anode
  technolgy used at its grande baie, quebec, and sebree, ky.,
  smelters was taken primarily for cost reasons.
as a result, it said, the estimated total cost of the
  planned smelter will be held to 450 mln u.s. dlrs, the low end
  of the range estimated in mid-may, while the cost of the first
  phase was cut to 150 mln dlrs from the projected 175-225 mln
  dlrs.
german experts say no further economic stimulus
  the west german government's independent
  council of economic experts believes a further stimulation of
  the economy is inappropriate, government spokesman friedhelm
  ost said.
a statement released by ost after a meeting of chancellor
  helmut kohl and senior government officials with the council
  said the experts believed 1987 ecomomic growth of 1-1/2 to two
  pct was achievable.
it added the council believed "an intensification of the
  already expansionary stimulation of monetary and financial
  policy is not called for."
ost's statement said experts believed further pressure on
  west germany to adapt to external economic factors would not
  increase.
the government regularly uses the term "changed external
  economic factors" when referring to the fall of the dollar,
  which has severely damaged west german exports.
bonn officials
  have said they expect exports to pick up during the year, but
  could still fall below the 1986 level.
along with other leading industrial countries, west germany
  agreed to a package of measures at a meeting in paris in
  february aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar.
the stance taken by the experts backs up the official
  position of the west german government ahead of next week's
  seven nation summit in venice, where bonn is expected to be
  pressed by the u.s. and other partners to boost its economy.
west german government officials have stressed bonn is not
  in a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts due
  next year and 1990 are already stretching the budget.
the bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in official
  interest rates although it sees market rates continuing low.
the experts' prediction for economic growth this year of
  between 1-1/2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from a
  forecast made last november when two pct growth was forecast.
many independent forecasters have revised down 1987
  predictions in light of the downturn in exports.
the government
  itself has said it expects growth of just under two pct,
  compared with a 2.4 pct expansion in 1986.

ex-usda official urges chicken handling labels
  a former u.s. agriculture department
  official urged the department to require that packages of
  chicken be labeled with handling and cooking instructions to
  protect the public from disease.
carol tucker foreman, president of foreman and heidepriem
  and a former assistant secretary of agriculture for food and
  consumer services, told a house agriculture subcommittee, "every
  hour of every day, 22 americans become victims of chicken
  contaminated with salmonella."
she said every two and a half weeks, an american dies of
  salmonellosis or complications arising from it and the
  incidence of poisoning from poultry has increased steadily over
  the past several years.
foreman said usda should follow a national academy of
  sciences recommendation to label chicken packages to remind
  consumers of preparation procedures necessary to avoid illness.
she urged usda to require that birds be washed thoroughly
  before they are defeathered and that defeathering machines be
  cleaned several times a day, that birds be condemned if their
  intestines are punctured or there is visible fecal
  contamination and that chiller water be changed more often.
kenneth blaylock, president of the american federation of
  government employees, said a poultry industry recommendation to
  move away from the current bird-by-bird inspection could prove
  "disastrous."
he said a strengthened bird-by-bird inspection with
  slower line speeds was the foundation upon which new inspection
  techniques should be overlaid.

u.s. weighs lifting japanese trade curbs
  the white house has completed a new
  review of japanese semiconductor trading practices but has not
  yet decided whether trade sanctions levied against japan last
  april should be lifted, u.s. officials said.
they said the president's economic policy council looked at
  japan's adherence to the 1986 u.s.-japanese semiconductor pact
  yesterday and that an announcement may be made shortly.
but there was no hint what the announcement might be.
officials have said the 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs of
  japanese exports could be modified if japan was found to be
  honoring a portion of its semiconductor pact.
but they also noted that the white house has said it was
  unlikely the tariffs would be lifted before the meeting of the
  world's seven major economic powers in venice on june 8-10.
the officials added that while the curbs complicated
  u.s.-japanese economic cooperation, they did serve to blunt 
  congressional criticism that the reagan administrtation was not
  taking tough actions to reduce he u.s. trade deficit.
reagan imposed the sanctions on april 17 in retaliation for
  japan's failure to honor commitments to end dumping
  semiconductors in world markets at less than production costs
  and to open its own market to u.s. goods.
the sanctions were levied on certain japanese television
  sets, personal computers and hand-held power tools.
reagan, in imposing the curbs, said they would be lifted as
  soon as there was evidence of a pattern that japan was adhering
  to the pact.
u.s. house speaker wright concerned of interest rate rise under greenspan

energy secretary sees higher oil prices
  energy secretary donald hodel said he
  expects oil prices to rise significantly by the year 2000,
  probably to around 33 dlrs a barrel in current dollars.
"i do anticipate a significant increase (by 2000).
thirty-three dlrs a barrel is not unreasonable," hodel told the
  senate energy committee.
hodel said the loss of some domestic oil production through
  the shutdown of stripper (10 barrels a day or less) wells
  because of low prices was probably permanent.
he said he was
  also concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration.
hodel urged congress to approve oil exploration in section
  1002 of the arctic national wildlife refuge in alaska.
he said
  geologic condtions in the area were favorable for the discovery
  of oil fields equal to those in nearby prudhoe bay.
"the area could contain potentially recoverable oil
  resources of more than 9.2 billion barrels, an amount nearly
  equal to the prudhoe bay oil field, which currently provides
  almost one-fifth of u.s. domestic production," hodel said.
he said production from the new section could begin about
  the time prudhoe bay production begins to decline in 2000
  without endangering caribou or other wildlife in the area.
danish reserves rise 10.5 billion crowns in may
  denmark's net official reserves rose
  to 60.629 billion crowns in may from 48.380 billion in april,
  against 39.481 billion in may 1986, the central bank said in
  its monthly balance sheet report.
total net reserves, including reserves held by commercial
  and major savings banks and corrected for exchange rate
  adjustments, rose to 58.373 billion crowns in may from 47.835
  billion in april, against 32.443 billion in may 1986.
the bank said in a statement that public loan transactions
  accounted for net capital import of 0.1 billion crowns in may,
  with net registered private capital imports of 9.1 billion.
"of this, the net sale of danish crown bonds to other
  countries totalled about 2.5 billion crowns.
there was balance
  between the purchase and sale of foreign securities," the
  statement added.
the central bank said that figures for private bank
  reserves and registered capital movements were provisional and
  there was no estimate yet of unregistered movements.
"it is therefore not possible on this basis to draw
  conclusions about the developments of the external current
  account," the statement added.

tight far east freight space hits sugar market
  the far eastern sugar market is being hit
  by a tightening in available nearby freight space needed to
  move raw sugar to various destinations, notably from thailand,
  traders said.
this has resulted in a hardening of freight rates in those
  areas.
these are now being quoted between 12.5 and 17.5 dlrs a
  tonne per day, depending on shipment and destination, against
  recent fixings below 12 dlrs a tonne.
charterers are considering combining contracted shipments
  because of inadequate space, shipping sources said, noting 13
  raws cargoes are awaiting shipment from various ports.
a cargo of thai raw sugar was reported traded at basis july

  traders said.
but others said this was old business.
ncnb &lt;ncb> to merge with (centrabank)
  ncnb corp said the board of

the company said the board's approval included the
  dismissal of a protest by the baltimore-based maryland alliance
  for responsible investing against ncnb's performance under the

the company said maryland alliance wanted the merger
  blocked on the grounds that ncnb inadequately served the credit

the company said it denied the claim.
leutwiler wants firmer mark against sfr
  fritz leutwiler, chairman of
  bbc ag brown boveri und cie and a former swiss national bank
  president, urged the national bank to declare its intent of
  achieving a rising rate for the mark against the swiss franc.
in a speech to shareholders, leutwiler said, "a gradually
  rising rate for the mark in relation to the franc would be
  desirable from the standpoint of industrial exports and with
  regard to sustaining swiss industry."
"simply an appropriate declaration of intent by our bank of
  issue (swiss national bank) could have a positive effect," he
  said.
leutwiler, who served 10 years as head of the swiss central
  bank, said such a step would not contradict the national bank's
  target of monetary stability.
"bringing the franc close to the mark would, of course, have
  to be done step by step under the watchful eye of monetary
  policy," he told shareholders.
"realistically there is in fact no
  persuasive reason why the german currency is quoted almost 20
  pct lower than the swiss."
a national bank spokesman said the relation of the mark and
  swiss franc was an example of stable currency parities over a
  long period of time.
the spokesman said exchange rates were made by the market,
  not the central bank, and it would be impossible to influence
  individual parities separately.
leutwiler said the swiss national bank could not support
  the value of the dollar, even in conjunction with other central
  banks, without putting monetary stability in jeopardy.
"i would be the last to recommend that.
the key to a
  stronger dollar lies in the united states itself," leutwiler
  said.
spectra-physics &lt;spy> mulls sale, restructure
  spectra-physics inc said it is
  considering the possibility of recapitalizing, restructuring,
  or seeking a buyer for the company following its rejection of
  an unsolicitied 32 dlr a share bid from ciba-geigy corp.
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission,
  the san jose, calif., gas lasers and accessories company also
  said its board sunday agreed to a plan that gives 52 top
  executives bonuses ranging from 20 to 50 pct of their base
  salary if they stay with the company through august 29.
in rejecting the takeover proposal by the u.s. subsidiary
  of swiss-based ciba-geigy ag, the company said it was unfair.
the spectra-physics board voted unanimously, with two
  ciba-geigy representatives not participating, to reject the
  swiss-based chemical and pharmaceutical company's takeover bid,
  citing an opinion from its financial advsior, morgan stanley
  and co inc, that it is "inadequate and unfair from a financial
  point of view to the holders of shares," the company said.
the board also authorized a special committee and morgan
  stanley to "vigorously investigate, pursue and authorize any
  alternatives which would maximize the value of shareholders'
  investment in the company," the company said.
among the alternatives the special committee will consider
  are a sale of the company to a third party for more than 32
  dlrs a share, a recapitalization or restructuring, including
  self tender offers and/or asset dispositions through the use of
  dividends, spectra-physics said.
the "retention plan" for the 52 top officers will pay an
  average bonus percentage of 28 pct of salary, it said.
spectra-physics said its board approved the plan "in order
  to encourage key operating personnel to remain with the company
  during the period of turmoil and uncertainty engendered by the
  (ciba-geigy) offer."
under the plan, the executives would be entitled to their
  cash bonuses if they stay with the company through august 29,
  but could receive them earlier if they are fired for reasons
  other than gross and willful misconduct, or if they leave the
  company because their salaries have been sharply cut.
spectra-physics also said it filed suit against ciba-geigy
  yesterday in u.s. district court in wilmington, del., charging
  it with making a takeover bid that was false and misleading in
  violation of securities law and with violating the intent of
  july 9, 1985 standstill agreement.
spectra-physics said ciba-geigy indicated at the time of
  the standstill agreement that it would not make an unsolicited
  takeover proposal for the company and that the intent of the
  agreement was that ciba-geigy would not acquire more than 20
  pct of the company unless there was another takeover threat.
ciba-geigy was 18.8 pct of spectra-physics and reliance
  group holdings &lt;rel>, which is controlled by new york investor
  saul steinberg, controls 12.8 pct.
spectra-physics said the agreement prevents ciba-geigy from
  raising its stake beyond 20 pct through jan 1, 1992, unless
  another person get more than 10 pct of its voting power.
volcker departure revives dlr, inflation fears
  paul volcker's decision not to go for a
  third term as federal reserve chairman and the nomination of
  alan greenspan to replace him have revived deep concerns about
  the u.s.' ability to prevent a further dollar decline and stem
  rising inflation, financial market analysts said.
although greenspan is known as a committed anti-inflation
  fighter in the volcker mould, doubts are already surfacing in
  the u.s. financial markets as to whether he has enough
  political clout and monetary experience to wage a tough
  campaign against inflation over the next year or two.
"the critical issue is how (greenspan) will deal with
  inflation," said stephen axilrod, vice chairman of nikko
  securities co international inc and former staff director for
  monetary and financial policy at the fed.
"a lot of questions have been raised by volcker's
  departure.
until greenspan answers them, the markets will
  remain nervous," added stephen slifer, money market economist
  at shearson lehman government securities inc.
this morning's announcement sent the dollar into a
  tailspin, which was halted only by concerted central bank
  intervention in the open currency market.

small rise seen in u.s.
gasoline inventories
  u.s. analysts expect the american
  petroleum institute's weekly report on oil inventories to show
  a slight build in u.s. stocks of gasoline for the week ended
  may 29, oil traders and analysts said.
while the consensus is for an increase, a few would not
  rule out the possibility of an decline.
traders said that
  barring any surprises in tonight's report, they expect the
  report to be neutral to bearish for oil prices.
heating oil stocks are also likely to build and runs to be
  steady to slightly higher, which could add pressure on oil
  prices, the analysts said.
crude oil was seen likely to build assuming imports
  continue at relatively high levels.
analysts expect gasoline stocks to rise 500,000 to two mln
  barrels above the 234 mln reported for may 22.
peter beutel, oil analyst with elders futures inc, who
  looks for a build said, "we have had five weeks of gasoline
  demand at 7.3 mln bpd or more and it is likely to taper off to
  between 6.7-7.0 mln bpd, which should make stocks build.
demand
  would have to stay above 7.0 mln bpd to have a draw," he added.
rising demand is why oil traders and analysts expect a draw
  in stocks of about of about one mln barrels.
the u.s. energy information administration in its latest
  report for the four weeks ending may 22 said that gasoline
  demand was up 4.4 pct to 7.3 mln bpd from the previous year.
but analysts said hopes of reduced stocks is likely to
  founder on increased runs in refineries, which could be up 0.3
  pct above may 22's 81.2 pct capacity operated.
such an increase would raise runs about 100,000 bpd and add
  to u.s. stocks.
but some analysts said that refiners may have held refinery
  runs.
heating oil stocks were also expected to build between
  700,000 barrels and one mln from the 96 mln barrel level
  reported last week, but a rise in distillate stocks was
  discounted as having a market impact at this time.
"a build is seasonal now and not out of line with last year,"
  one futures analyst said.
analysts said they also expect crude oil stocks to build
  between 1.5 mln barrels and three mln from the 325 mln barrels
  reported by api for the week of may 22.
the consensus appears for about two mln barrels to be added
  to the nation's inventory.
shultz welcomes tokyo economic package
  u.s. secretary of state george shultz said
  the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by tokyo last
  week went further than the u.s. had expected.
but he said the u.s. would not lift the selective economic
  sanctions it imposed on japanese imports in april until tokyo
  changed its sales policies concerning computer microchips.
speaking in a televised news conference linking several
  european capitals, shultz said it was heartening that the
  japanese had confronted the problem of stimulating domestic and
  global demand.
"there is an even greater amount of stimulus than was
  originally thought," said shultz, speaking from washington.
"it is a lot more than nothing.
it is more than was talked
  about when (prime minister yasuhiro) nakasone was here.
"it involves a major reduction in tax rates and we believe
  that getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating the
  economy," he added.
but asked by japanese reporters, also linked into the news
  conference, whether the positive reaction meant the u.s. might
  decide at next week's venice summit to lift its sanctions on
  some japanese electronic goods, shultz replied:
      "these sanctions were undertaken on the basis of an
  agreement that had been reached between the united states and
  japan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chip
  market.
"they will be lifted as the facts of change by japan to the
  agreement that it made become evident."
he said u.s. officials had only been able to monitor the
  situation for a month and that it was impossible to determine a
  trend on only one month's data.
the u.s.
imposed 100 pct import duties on personal
  computers, colour televisions and power tools, alleging that
  japan had violated last september's bilateral agreement by
  selling computer chips at below fair market value.
shultz said west germany and other nations would also do
  well to look at what they could do to stimulate demand.
asked whether the u.s. could reasonably ask its allies to
  take action to stimulate the world economy without a bold
  american initiative to reduce the size of the federal budget
  deficit, shultz said moves were already underway to tackle the
  problem.
he said by the end of the current fiscal year the deficit
  would probably be reduced by around 35 billion dlrs against
  last year, and that the budget being worked on this year would
  contain a major reduction.
champion home &lt;chb> sells two properties
  champion home builders inc said it
  sold the commerce meadows 600-site manufactured housing rental
  community in commerce township, michigan, for a pre-tax gain of
  about 900,000 dlrs and the heron cay 610-site adult community
  in vero beach, florida, for a nominal pre-tax gain.
the company said the sales proceeds will be partly used to
  reduce debt.
it said it is shifting its focus away from the
  development of communities requiring significant equity and
  having lengthy projected life cycles.
the company also said along with local landowners and
  investors, it will acquire 33-acre tract northtowne meadows in
  the toledo, ohio, area for development into 160 home sites and
  three acres of commercial land.
terms of the transactions and other parties involved were
  not disclosed.
acp states say ec oils tax plan breaks accords
  developing countries said the european
  community (ec) would breach two international agreements if it
  went ahead with its plans for an oils and fats tax.
ambassadors to the ec from african, caribbean and pacific
  (acp) states told a press conference the tax would hit the
  exports of 26 acp countries.
they said the ec failed to follow consultation procedures
  laid down in the lome convention which regulates relations
  between acp states and the bloc for moves which could affect
  trade between the two sides.
they also said the ec would be in breach of an undertaking
  not to bring in new protectionist measures during the current
  punta del este round of world trade negotiations being held
  under gatt (general agreement on tariffs and trade) auspices.
the ec commission has proposed a tax of up to 330 european
  currency units (ecus) a tonne on both imported and ec-produced
  vegetable and marine fats for human consumption, which could
  raise up to two billion ecus a year.
ec farm ministers, who would have to approve such a tax,
  are split on the issue and are expected to decide it at a
  marathon meeting on ec farm prices beginning in luxembourg on
  june 15.
jamaican ambassador leslie wilson said acp countries are
  convinced this would lead to ec industry substituting products
  made within the bloc for oil and fat imports.
the acp estimates
  this would result in a fall of 160 to 185 mln ecus in its
  member country exports.
"we can't believe the ec would willingly take measures to
  undermine our countries, but such would be the impact of these
  measures," wilson said.
the u.s. and malaysia say their exports would also be hit
  by the proposed tax and they may take retaliatory action if it
  is approved.
wilson said the acp would take such steps only "as a very
  last resort," but added that the acp is in touch with other
  countries which oppose the plan.
wilson, who was chairing the news conference, made it clear
  jamaica itself would not be hit by the tax as it does not
  export oils and fats.
among the worst hit countries would be ivory coast,
  senegal, nigeria and papua new guinea, the acp says.

need for bigger allied force in gulf played down
  secretary of state george shultz said
  today that a boost in allied forces in the mideast gulf was not
  vital to protect shipping against attack but that possible
  allied contributions should be examined.
asked if he saw the need for a greater military presence by
  the allies in the gulf, shultz told reporters, "not necessarily,

but he said an adequate force was needed to deter attack
  and noted that the british and the french, as well as the

skyline &lt;skx.v> expects to begin mine in july
  skyline explorations ltd said expects
  construction can begin next month on a gold mine at johnny
  mountain camp, located 600 miles north of vancouver.
the company said a contract has been let for a 200 to 400
  tons per day mill and the company is receiving cooperation from
  provincial and federal agencies on its stage one report,
  "approval in principal," which is required before actual
  construction can begin.
skyline said it is optimistic the approval in principal
  will be received in late june, by which time it expects to have
  confirmed threshold tonnage and grade targets so construction
  can begin in july.
skyline said the 1987 exploration drift on 16 vien east at
  johnny mountain has advanced 320 feet.
the vein is continuous,
  averaging four feet thick plus an altered mineralized hanging
  wall.
it said periodic face samples indicate an average grade of
  1.05 ounces per ton of ore ranging from a low of 0.78 ounce per
  ton to a high of 55.8 ounces per ton.
soycomplex could rally on tight u.s. feed supply
  nearby months in soybean and soymeal
  futures could post a short-term rally on tightening supply of
  livestock feed, even if favorable growing conditions keep the
  new crop outlook bearish, traders said.
"a lot of soymeal dealers are just getting very worried
  about where processors will get their soybeans this summer,"
  one illinois soyproduct dealer said.
processors are competing vigorously with river dealers for
  the few soybeans being offered by country elevators, with a
  decatur, illinois processor raising its spot soybean basis bid
  another two cents today to 10 over july futures.
farmer marketings of old crop soybeans continue very light,
  with flat prices apparently well below levels they are willing
  to sell, dealers said.
some terminal elevator operators are coming to the belief
  that even if futures rally back to last month's highs, country
  movement may remain light because farmers in many areas are
  sold out of old crop soybeans, particularly in the eastern half
  of the midwest.
soybean processors will continue to take seasonal downtime
  for maintenance if soybeans remain difficult to buy, reducing
  the weekly soybean crush rate still further and keeping the
  spot soymeal basis strong, dealers said.
futures traders said tight cash supplies should help july
  soybeans and soymeal gain on deferreds.
july soymeal has
  already moved to a premium over the august through october
  months and old crop july/new crop november soybeans may also
  move to a july premium later this month, they added.

kaufman says greenspan nomination bad for bonds
  henry kaufman, managing director of
  salomon brothers inc, said the nomination of economist alan
  greenspan to replace federal reserve board chairman paul
  volcker is bearish in the near term for the fixed income and
  currency markets.
"the basic direction of interest rates is not changed.
the
  fundamental direction of interest rates continues to be upward,
  interrupted by intermittent rallies," kaufman said in a
  statement.
he said the implication for equity markets in
  neutral to bullish.
kaufman said, "unlike paul volcker, who entered the office
  of the federal reserve chairman with strong credibility both
  domestically and internationally, mr greenspan will have to
  demonstrate both his competence and policy independence before
  he can gain full confidence of the financial markets."
greenspan is most knowledgeable on the behavior of the u.s.
  economy, while his professional skills in the international
  area are much more limited, kaufman noted.
"consequently, although he is well known abroad, his views
  on issues such as the less developed country debt may initially
  carry less weight than have those of mr volcker."
major u.s.
pipeline may be closed several days
  the operator of a major u.s. crude oil
  pipeline, shutdown because of flood damage, said it may be
  several days before repairs are made and the system is
  functioning again.
dan stevens, manager of public and government affairs at
  texaco inc &lt;tx>, operator of the pipeline through its
  subsidiary texaco pipeline co, said the company hopes repairs
  will begin in about five days and expects it to take several
  more days to complete.
"at this point we are lining up what we know we need, to get
  the job done," stevens said, adding that the timing for repairs
  will depend on the damage to the pipeline which is difficult to
  assess because of flooding on the red river.
the pipeline was shipping roughly 225,000 barrels of crude
  oil per day, or about 55 pct of its capacity during the 30 days
  preceding its shutdown on saturday, stevens said.
the pipeline was shut down from cushing, okla, to witchita
  falls, kan, on saturday due to an undetermined leak at the red
  river crossing, near the oklahoma/texas border, because of
  severe rains, a spokesman for texaco said.
stevens said it was reasonable to suggest the pipeline
  could operate at full capacity when it reopens in order to make
  up for the shortfull but cautioned they will talk with
  customers to determine their requirements.
oil analysts and traders said they were not sure if the 
  shutdown will continue to raise u.s. oil prices.
monday, after texaco confirmed that the pipeline had been
  closed, west texas intermediate crude in the spot market and on
  new york mercantile exchange's energy futures complex rose 20

lynch &lt;lgl> plans offer for becor &lt;bcw> stock
  lynch corp said it will offer 10.50 dlrs

  outstanding.
lynch said its proposed offer "substantially improves" over
  the offer of 10.45 dlrs a share in cash and 4.00 dlrs of senior
  sinking fund debentures made by bcw acquisition inc, formed by
  becor's management.
lynch chairman mario gabelli, who heads a group which owns
  12.35 pct of becor's 16.5 mln outstanding shares, said the
  lynch bid "is about one dlr better than the present offer."
gabelli previously said in a filing with the securities and

  unfar.
the lynch officer said he was invited by other becor

overseas &lt;osg> sees opec quotas key to rates
  overseas shipholding group inc president
  morton hyman said if oil production by opec rises during the
  second half of 1987, freight rates for tankers should rise
  accordingly.
hyman, delivering a speech at the annual shareholders
  meeting, said international tanker markets were generally weak
  throughout the first quarter, but since the end of march opec
  oil production has picked up.
the result has been a modest
  improvement in tanker rates.
overseas said 73 pct of its fleet handles liquid cargo.
he said tanker requirements decreased in september 1986 as
  opec production quotas dropped and levels of oil stocks rose.
for the first quarter 1987, the company reported net income
  of 10.3 mln dlrs, or 40 cts per share, compared to 9.3 mln
  dlrs, or 36 cts per share, for the comparable quarter a year
  ago.
the company reported net income for 1986 of 37.3 mln dlrs,
  or 1.45 dlrs per share.
"the improvement in the company's 1986 results, after four
  years of declining earnings, reflects a sharp, albeit
  temporary, rise in freight rates in the international tanker
  markets last summer," hyman said.
he said the alaskan oil trade continues to be the principal
  source of employment for its u.s. flag tanker fleet, which
  represents approximately 15 pct of the company's tonnage.
overseas owns and operates 67 vessels.

icco buffer stock manager to buy 3,000 tonnes cocoa wednesday, june 3 - official

  icco buffer stock manager to buy 3,000 tonnes cocoa wednesday, june 3 - official
icco buffer to buy 3,000 tonnes cocoa june 3
  the buffer stock manager of the
  international cocoa organization (icco) will tender for about
  3,000 tonnes of cocoa beans wednesday, june 3, the icco said in
  a statement.
it said all other conditions remain unchanged from the
  previous announcement.
these conditions are that offers from registered companies
  should be in pounds sterling for cocoa beans for which standard
  differentials have been set in the icco's buffer stock rules,
  and can be for cocoa afloat through to december shipment and
  spot to december arrival/delivery.
the basis position will be afloat, may/july shipment or
  june arrival/delivery.
for later positions the appropriate
  carrying costs will be taken into account.
the deadline for the receipt of offers by the manager shall
  be 1330 hrs london time (1230 gmt) in the case of offers
  emanating from the secondhand market and 1400 hours in the case
  of offers emanating from the origins.
the competitiveness of offers will be assessed by taking
  into account the standard differentials, the cost of taking
  cocoa into store (currently 23.00 pounds sterling from "cif
  landed" and 38.00 pounds sterling from "cif shipping weights"
  to "in store") and the cost of carry which currently is 12.00
  pounds sterling per month, the icco said.
no more than four offers will be considered from each
  offering party, it added.

fuel storage tanks in france burst into flames
  two people were missing and six
  injured after tanks containing thousands of cubic metres of
  fuel burst into flames today at a shell storage unit in lyon,
  rescue workers said.
the blaze broke out with an explosion around 1330 local
  time (1130 gmt).
shell is a subsidiary of the royal dutch/shell

the fire destroyed five giant tanks and threatened four
  others, the shell spokesman said.
he said that the company
  estimated between six and seven thousand cubic metres of

pay 'n pak &lt;pnp> receives amended proposal
  pay 'n pak stores inc said it
  received a revision to one of the two previously disclosed
  proposals to buy the company.
pay 'n pak said that the proposal from a leveraged buyout
  firm had been amended to increase the dividend rate on the
  cumulative preferred stock to be received by pnp shareholders
  from 13.5 pct to 17.5 pct.
as previoiusly announced, the proposal calls for a
  transaction in which pnp shareholders would receive a
  combination of 17.50 dlrs in cash and 2.50 dlrs in liquidation
  value of cumulative preferred stock for each common share.
under the other proposal received from paul bilzerian, pnp
  shareholders would receive on a blended basis 16.67 dlrs in
  cash and 3.33 dlrs in liquidation value of cumulative
  redeemable preferred stock for each common share, the company
  said.
under the bilzerian proposal, the dividend rate on the
  preferred stock would be set so that in the joint opinion of
  the financial advisor to bilzerian and the financial advisor to
  pay 'n pak, the preferred stock would trade at its liquidation
  value on a fully distributed basis, the company said.
u.s. to protect only american ships
  u.s. military forces in the mideast
  gulf are under orders to protect only american flag vessels and
  occasional u.s. arms deliveries on other ships to
  "non-belligerent" states in the area, the pentagon said today.
"no one has ever stated or supported a policy of protecting
  all shipping in those waters," pentagon spokesman bob sims said
  as the reagan administration drew up plans to increase the
  protective u.s. military presence in the gulf.
sims denied published reports that u.s. defense secretary
  caspar weinberger sought air cover to protect all neutral
  shipping in the western gulf from attacks by iran and iraq.
"as we have said repeatedly, only american flag vessels are
  under our protection with the exception, on a limited
  case-by-case basis, of ships carrying our foreign military
  sales equipment to friendly, non-belligerent states in the
  region," sims said.
u.s. warships in the gulf two weeks ago protected a kuwaiti
  ship which sailed to bahrain with u.s. arms for bahrain and
  kuwait.
but sims said washington had received assurances that
  the the arms would not be used elsewhere.
he said kuwait, which is turning 11 oil tankers over to
  u.s. firms to fly the american flag and be protected by the
  u.s. warships, is not considered a belligerent despite iranian
  charges that kuwait is supporting iraq in the gulf war.
kuwaiti tankers have come under repeated iranian attack.
sims refused to say how the united states will beef up its
  seven-ship middle east task force in the gulf to protect the 11
  kuaiti tankers.
but pentagon officials said that additional
  ships and air cover are under consideration.

holllinger &lt;hlg.to> paying 50 mln dlrs for buy
  hollinger inc will pay about 50 mln dlrs
  cash for its previously reported acquisition of privately owned
  unimedia inc, chairman conrad black told reporters after the
  annual meeting, confirming a published report.
commenting on press reports about the 50 mln dlr price tag,
  black said, "that would not be wildly inaccurate," although he
  declined to disclose the actual cost.
montreal-based unimedia is quebec's third largest newspaper
  group, with three french language daily newspapers in quebec
  city, ottawa and chicoutimi, quebec and four printing plants in
  ontario and quebec.
black added that hollinger would also continue seeking
  acquisitions of daily newspapers with circulation under 25,000
  readers.
he said hollinger was currently talking to about 10
  such newspapers in the u.s. where the company currently owns 23
  dailies.
"there is really no end to the ones that are available," he
  told reporters, although he added that most remaining
  acquisition opportunities are in the u.s.
he said that hollinger's 58 pct-owned daily telegraph plc,
  of london, should become profitable in this year's fourth
  quarter.
for full-year 1987, the daily telegraph could break even or
  better, said black, citing major reductions in labor costs and
  improved technology at the telegraph, britain's largest
  circulation quality daily.
the telegraph lost 13.2 mln canadian
  dlrs last year.
daily telegraph chief executive andrew knight told
  reporters after the meeting that the telegraph's daily
  circulation had risen by 25,000 since september to about
  1,150,000 on weekdays, despite added competition from the new
  independent daily newspaper.
knight said the independent was not affecting the
  telegraph's growth, but was making inroads into the circulation
  of other london quality dailies such as the times and the
  guardian.
hollinger chairman black predicted hollinger would post
  1987 net income of about 55 mln dlrs, or one dlr a share,
  including extraordinary gains from previous sales of
  discontinued operations.
hollinger lost 87 mln dlrs or 6.54
  dlrs a share last year on fewer average shares and after an
  extraordinary loss of 52 mln dlrs.
black told shareholders that first quarter operating
  earnings on continuing operations amounted to 499,000 dlrs
  against a year-ago loss of 165,000 dlrs.
revenues on continuing operations rose to 102.1 mln dlrs
  from 1.5 mln dlrs last year, which did not include daily
  telegraph revenues, he added.
consolidated first quarter
  figures were not disclosed.
he said the daily telegraph's first quarter operating loss
  was sharply reduced from last year.
texas eastern &lt;tex> unit files for new rates

reagan seeks romania trade concession
  president reagan called for continued
  nondiscriminatory treatment for romanian exports to the united
  states in the face of congressional opposition because of the
  bucharest government's record on human rights.
a white house statement said reagan's decision to press for
  continuation of so-called most favored nation (mfn) status for
  romania had been "exceptionally difficult" and came after "all
  options were seriously considered."
but the statement said that despite concerns about human
  rights abuses by the bucharest government, the president had
  decided that should be continued because it helped stimulate
  emigration from romania and gave the united states influence on
  human rights practices there.
the statement was issued as reagan sent to congress
  requests for one-year extensions of mfn for romania, hungary
  and china.
the house of representatives has attached to a trade bill
  legislation that would temporarily deny mfn for romania pending
  certification by reagan that the country had made progress on
  human rights.
there is no controversy over continuation of mfn
  for hungary and china.

ccc accepts bonus on barley to saudi arabia
  the commodity credit corporation, ccc,
  has accepted bids for export bouses to cover sales of 150,000
  tonnes of u.s. barley to saudi arabia, the u.s. agriculture
  department said.
the ccc accepted three bonus offers from one exporter which
  averaged 40.88 dlrs per tonne, it said.
the barley is for delivery august 15-november 30 in three
  shiments of 50,000 tonnes each.
the bonus awards were made to louis dreyfus corporation and
  will be paid in the form of commodities from ccc stocks.
an additional 350,000 tonnes of u.s. barley are still
  available to saudi arabia under the export enhancement program
  initiative annnounced on may 15, 1987, it said.
last-minute opposition to gulf bill arises
  house speaker jim wright predicted
  passage of legislation requiring the reagan administration to
  provide congress with a report on its mideast gulf policy, but
  a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberals and
  conservatives left the bill's fate in doubt.
the legislation was written in the wake of the may 17th
  iraqi missile attack on the u.s. frigate stark in the gulf,
  which killed 37 americans, and president reagan's decision to
  protect 11 kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under u.s. flags
  -- effectively making them american ships.
since the administration made known its reflagging plans,
  congressional leaders complained they had not been consulted,
  and some charged the policy could lead the united states into
  the 6 1/2-year-old war between iran and iraq.
the house was to vote today on a bill -- supported by the
  democratic and republican congressional leadership and the
  administration -- which demanded a report within seven days on
  plans to meet the security needs of u.s. forces in the gulf.
the resolution was expected to pass without controversy
  today in the house foreign affairs committee before the full
  house was to take up the bill.
but in a surprise move, liberal
  democrats and conservative republicans on the committee joined
  in an unusual alliance to oppose the resolution.
liberal democrats said a lack of any restrictions in the
  bill implied consent to reagan's policies.
usda sets 0/92 provision for some producers
  some producers in the 1987 acreage
  reduction program may be eligible for deficiency payments on 92
  pct of their enrolled acreage even though none of it is planted
  with wheat or other program crops, the u.s. agriculture
  department said.
the department said the provision of the farm disaster
  assistance act will be available to all eligible winter wheat
  producers, producers of other types of wheat who were prevented
  from planting their 1987 wheat crop because of a 1986 natural
  disaster, and all producers who operate farms with program crop
  acreage bases subject to flooding on 50 pct of such crop's
  permitted acreage.
a producer who did not enroll in the 1987 acreage reduction
  program may become eligible by signing-up no later than july
  15.
producers will be informed by the local offices when
  applications are being accepted, it said.
the department said producers of wheat other than winter
  wheat may use the 0/92 option if they were preventedf from
  planting their intended acreage with wheat for harvest in 1987
  because of any natural disasters which occured in 1986 or if
  the farm is located in a county approved by farmers home
  administration for emergency loans for such disasters that
  occurred in 1986.
ccc accepts bonus on poultry to iraq -- usda
  the commodity credit corporation (ccc)
  has accepted a bid for an export bonus to cover the sale of
  15,000 tonnes of frozen poultry to iraq, the u.s. agriculture
  department said.
the poultry is for shipment june-september and the bonus
  was 719.80 dlrs per tone, it said.
the bonus award was made to conagra poultry co and will be
  paid in the form of commodities from the inventory of ccc
  stocks.
the purchase completes the export enhancement initiative
  for frozen poultry to iraq announced december 22, 1986.
ccc accepts bonus on poultry to egypt -- usda
  the commodity credit corporation (ccc)
  has accepted a bid for two bonus offers to cover the sale of
  10,000 tonnes of frozen poultry to egypt, the u.s. agriculture
  department said.
the poultry is for shipment november, 1987, through august,
  1988, and the bonus was 473.99 dlrs per tonne for the frozen
  fryer legs.
the bonuses were made to gress foods, inc (5,000
  tonnes), and serva international ltd (5,000 tonnes).
the subsidies will be paid to the exporters in the form of
  commodities from ccc stocks.
an additional 8,500 tonnes of frozen poultry remain
  available to egypt under the export enhancement program
  initiative announced dec 19, 1986, and feb 27, 1987, the
  department said.
phelps dodge &lt;pd> sees stronger copper prices
  phelps dodge corp officials said good
  fundamentals in copper markets should lead to improving prices
  for the metal.
in an interview with reuters, chairman g. robert durham
  said continued strong demand and low inventories pushed prices
  up eight to nine pct on the new york commodities exchange last
  month.
"our customers in this country are living off the tailgates
  of our trucks," he said, referring to tightness of supply and
  strong demand.
"the fundamentals are good."
asked if metal prices will continue to rise, durham said;
  "all i know is, fundamentals cannot be ignored."
he said copper supplies are lower than they have been for
  almost 20 years.
last year, copper demand was second highest on
  record behind 1984, he said.
phelps dodge is the nation's largest copper company, with
  annual production expected to reach 500,000 tons this year.
during the interview, executive vice president douglas
  yearley said he believed it was only a matter of time before
  the copper price rose "because there aren't that many new
  projects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,
  will continue to grow modestly."
copper for july delivery rose more than two cts a pound to
  more than 69 cents in comex trading today.
a one cent a pound
  rise in copper prices yields 10 mln dlrs in annual earnings for
  phelps dodge, the company said.
"demand has been surprisingly good in 1987, in construction
  and other areas," yearley said.
new production later this year from a bingham, utah, mine
  owned by kennecott corp, a unit of british petroleum co plc's
  &lt;bp> standard oil co, a mine in new guinea and phelps dodge's
  own expanded morenci, ariz., mine will be offset by production
  shortfalls in mexico and zambia, he said.
durham said production costs at the new mexico-located
  chino mine will be in line with conventional copper production
  at the company's other mines by the fourth quarter.
the
  company's total production costs, including depreciation but
  before interest and corporate expense, should be below 50 cts a
  pound by late 1989 or 1990, he said.
ccc credit guarantees to haiti amended
  the commodity credit corporation (ccc)

the action increases the value of export credit guarantees
  for wood products to haiti from 1.8 to 2.8  mln dlrs and the
  total value of export credit guarantees authorized to haiti for
  the current fiscal year for all commodities to 12.0 mln dlrs,
  the department said.
all sales must be registered and exports completed by sept
  30, 1987, it noted.

u.s.
wheat in senegal market -- usda
  after a highly favorable reception of
  a trial batch of bread baked from 300 lbs of u.s. wheat flour
  last february, the senegalese appear ready to take delivery of
  a first tranche of 10,500 tonnes of mixed u.s. wheat, the u.s.
  agriculture department said.
in its report on u.s.
export markets for u.s.
grain, the
  department noted senegal had bought 100,000 tonnes of wheat
  under the export enhancement program last november, but local
  opposition from millers, accustomed to french wheat, has been
  delaying deliveries.
as a result there were a series of baking seminars as well
  as the trial batch, in an effort to satisfy local flour millers
  and convince key officials of the qualities of u.s. wheat.
the department said if deliveries of u.s. wheat to senegal
  remain on track, the u.s. could dominate a wheat market that
  had been expected to import 140,000 tonnes of mostly french
  wheat during the 1987/88 (july-june) season.

investment crucial to u.s.
textile recovery
  with more private investment, not more
  protection, the u.s. textile industry could become competitive
  with the most modern foreign producers, analysts from two
  congressional agencies said today.
the office of technology assessment, a nonpartisan arm of
  congress told a house ways and means trade subcommittee hearing
  there was still concern for the future of parts of the u.s.
  textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason for
  optimism than a few years ago.
"while textile producers are making significant
  investments, they could do more," ota analyst henry kelly said.
the congressional budget office (cbo), the nonpartisan
  budget analysis arm of congress, said federal loans or loan
  guarantees would be preferable options for congress rather than
  increased trade protection which could lead to foreign
  retaliation.
cbo analyst edward gramlich said past trade protections,
  first imposed in the 1950's have had only a small benefit for
  profits and investments of domestic firms.
trade subcommittee chairman, rep. sam gibbons, said the
  agencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion against
  congressional approval of protectionist textile quota
  legislation aimed mainly at western europe, japan and other
  asian textile producing countries.
president reagan last year vetoed a textile protection bill
  but it was reintroduced in this session of congress and is
  expected to be voted on in the house this year.
however, approval this year is in doubt because passage of
  a major trade bill without specific protections for textiles
  showed a weakening of support for the legislation.
most u.s. producers have fallen behind other foreign
  producers in the use of modern textile and apparel production
  equipment and net imports are growing faster than the domestic
  markets, kelly said.
he added that private investment in the textile and
  clothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-seventh
  the average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct.
despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports of
  textiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pct
  while u.s. production rose only 1.9 pct.
"the traditional industry seems destined to be replaced by
  new technology, imports, or some combination of both.
while the
  industry may not be able to compete in all domestic markets
  that it enjoyed twenty years ago, the results of our research
  indicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered,
  and that exports can be expanded," kelly said.

phelps dodge &lt;pd> sets sights on acquisition
  phelps dodge corp chairman g. robert
  durham said the company is prepared to make another large
  non-copper acquisition and that a deal could be struck in the
  near future.
in an interview with reuters, durham said the company was
  examining potential candidates but not yet talking with any.
he declined to name the companies but said a deal could
  occur as soon as the second half of 1987.
phelps dodge, which ranks as the largest copper producer in
  the u.s., last year paid 240 mln dlrs for columbian chemicals
  co, a maker of carbon black which is used in rubber and tires
  among other products.
the purchase was part of a strategic plan to diversify and
  eventually match earnings from non-copper operations and copper
  operations.
phelps dodge could spend between 250 mln and 500 mln dlrs
  to buy another non-copper company, durham said, citing about
  100 mln dlrs of cash and 580 mln dlrs of untapped bank credit.
any acquisition candidate would have to have a different
  economic cycle than copper, substantial earnings and good
  management, he said.
phelps dodge would only want a friendly
  deal, he added.
"we're not talking high-tech, or financial services or
  about a perfume company," he said.
"we want a good basic
  industrial company that will fit into our management
  structure," durham said.
during the interview, durham and other executives also said
  continued strong demand and tight copper supply should lead to
  higher prices for the metal.
"in my view, it's not a matter of if but when the price
  (for copper) will improve because there aren't that many new
  projects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,
  will continue to grow modestly," said executive vice president
  douglas yearley.
phelps dodge continues to lower its cost of
  producing copper, the executives said.
costs should be below 50
  cents a pound, after depreciation but before interest and
  corporate expense, by 1989 or 1990.
production costs are about 56 to 57 cents a pound now
  compared to one dlr a pound in 1981, some wall st analysts
  said.
durham said copper supplies are lower than they have been
  for almost 20 years and demand continued to be strong.
he declined to project results for the second quarter or
  year.
but he said the quarter was going well and the rise in
  copper prices in the last month will help results.
durham said last month that the second quarter should match
  the first quarter when earnings rose about 11 pct to 16.8 mln
  dlrs or 49 cts a share.
first quarter sales rose 61.5 pct to 372.9 mln dlrs,
  reflecting the acquisition of columbian chemicals and increased
  copper shipments from the chino copper mine in new mexico, also
  acquired last year.
analysts are projecting 1987 earnings of 2.20 dlrs to 2.75
  dlrs a share, up sharply from 1.79 dlrs in 1986.
treasury to publish u.s. reserve assets monthly
  the treasury department said it would

amoco &lt;an> says dome &lt;dmp> buy good for canada
  amoco corp's wholly owned amoco
  canada petroleum co ltd said its proposed 5.22-billion-
  canadian-dlr acquisition of dome petroleum ltd will benefit
  canada just like the foreign investment that made possible
  commercial development of alberta's oilsands.
amoco canada president t. don stacy told an oilsands
  conference that "amoco canada has presented the solution to the
  dome problem, and we're investing our confidence, dollars and
  determination to make that solution work."
the amoco buyout of debt-burdened dome has angered canadian
  nationalists, who want a canadian buyer for dome.
stacy described amoco canada's previously reported share
  offer proposal as a chance to increase canadian ownership of
  the country's oil and gas industry, now at about 50 pct.
he reiterated that amoco planned virtually no layoffs of
  dome employees.
he also reaffirmed that amoco would reinvest in
  amoco canada-dome properties all available cash flow for five
  years after the acquisition.

the bill passed 305-102 -- winning a necessary two-thirds
  of those voting -- despite a last-minute revolt by an alliance
  of liberal democrats and conservative republicans who sought to
  defeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislators
  oppose president reagan's policies in the region.
the legislation was passed in the wake of the may 17th
  iraqi missile attack on the u.s. frigate stark in the gulf,
  which killed 37 americans, and reagan's decision to protect 11
  kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under u.s. flags --
  effectively making them american ships.
the legislation -- supported by congress' democratic and
  republican leadership as well as by the administration --
  required defense secretary caspar weinberger to provide a
  report to congress, within seven days of enactment, on plans to
  protect u.s. warships and flag ships in the persian gulf.
it did not, however, place any restrictions on the
  administration as it proceeds to reflag the kuwaiti ships and
  thus has no immediate effect on u.s. policy.
the senate was expected to approve the legislation this
  week.
the bill would then be sent to reagan for signature.
supporters of the bill said passage of the bill was only a
  first step toward a greater congressional involvement in
  formulating policy.
but democratic critics said the bill did not ask the
  administration to address tough policy questions in the report.
u.s. senate team wants multinational gulf force
  the leaders of a u.s. senate team probing
  american defense strategy in the mideast gulf said they favored
  a multinational force to keep oil flowing through the waterway.
sen. john glenn and john warner, in kuwait as part of a
  gulf arab tour, said at a news conference that top officials in
  the area appeared ready to discuss extra facilities needed if
  the u.s. upgraded its defense role.
the senate team next heads for the united arab emirates,
  their last stop on a fact-finding mission prompted by reagan
  administration plans to let half of kuwait's 22-tanker fleet
  fly the u.s. flag.
glenn and warner said the u.s., britain and france, should
  explore the possibility of a unified gulf force.
"the american ships, the british ships, the french ships now
  talk to each other and all we've got to do is formalize this
  arrangement," warner said.
glenn said a multinational force could be effectively
  deployed within 24 hours of a decision.
glenn voiced a preference for a united nations
  multinational force, or failing that, an american, british,
  french force with cooperation from the gulf arab states.
warner voiced concern that the soviet union might use the
  situation in the gulf to raise its presence.
"and,
  unequivocally, all gcc states we have talked with, have said
  that would not be in the interests of the arabian peninsula."
colombian group suspends bombings of pipelines
  a colombian group announced the suspension
  of its bombings of oil pipelines pending the government's levy
  of a social tax on foreign petroleum companies and an 800 mln
  dlrs fine on the occidental petroleum corp &lt;oxy>.
there was no indication the government would meet the
  conditions demanded by the leftist national liberation army
  (eln).
according to the state oil firm, ecopetrol, the eln carried
  out 72 attacks on petroleum pipelines between 1984 and 1986.
the assaults, the most recent launched two months ago, have
  caused an estimated total of 50 mln dlrs in damage.
in a communique, the eln said it would demand a tax of one
  dollar per barrel of crude oil pumped by foreign firms as a
  condition for maintaining its suspension of the assaults.
foreign oil firms pump an average of 225,083 barrels per
  day in colombia.
colombian tax authorities are investigating
  occidental, a u.s.-owned firm, for alleged tax evasion.
if the charges are proven, the firm could face a fine of up
  to 800 mln dlrs.
the eln demands the government charge the
  penalty.
investment firms have 7.7 pct of midway &lt;mdwy.o>
  two affiliated investment firms told
  the securities and exchange commission they have acquired
  593,000 shares of midway airlines inc, or 7.7 pct of the total
  outstanding common stock.
the firms, boston-based fmr corp and fidelity international
  ltd, a bermuda-based investment advisory firm, said they bought
  the stake "to acquire an equity interest in the company in
  pursuit of specified investment objectives...."
      the firms said they may increase or decrease their stake in
  the company, but have no plans to seek control of the company
  or representation on its board.
wickes &lt;wix> completes purchase
  wickes cos inc said it has
  completed the purchase of dura corp for an undisclosed amount.
dura, a supplier of automotive equipment, had annual sales
  of over 100 mln dlrs.
cominco &lt;clt> sets tentative talks on strike
  cominco ltd said it set
  tentative talks with three striking union locals that rejected
  on saturday a three-year contract offer at cominco's trail and
  kimberley, british columbia lead-zinc operations.
the locals, part of united steelworkers of america,
  represent 2,600 production and maintenance workers.
no date has
  been set for the talks, the spokesman replied to a query.
the spokesman said talks were still ongoing with the two
  other striking locals, representing 600 office and technical
  workers.
production at trail and kimberley has been shut down
  since the strike started may 9.
each of the five locals has a separate contract that
  expired april 30, but the main issues are similar.
the trail smelter produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and
  110,000 long tons of lead last year, while the sullivan mine at
  kimberley produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year, most for
  processing at trail.
revenues from trail's smelter totaled 356 mln canadian dlrs
  in 1986.
phelps dodge seeks to diversify more from copper
  phelps dodge corp is prepared to make
  another large non-copper acquisition and a deal could be struck
  in the near future, chairman g. robert durham said.
durham told reuters the company was examining potential
  candidates but not yet talking with any.
any acquisition must
  have a different economic cycle to copper, he said.
phelps dodge, the largest u.s. copper producer, last year
  paid 240 mln dlrs for columbian chemicals co which makes carbon
  black used in rubber and tires.
the purchase was part of a
  strategic plan to diversify and then match earnings between
  copper and non-copper operations.
the company could spend between 250 mln and 500 mln dlrs to
  buy another non-copper firm, durham said, citing 100 mln dlrs
  of cash and 580 mln dlrs of untapped bank credit.
ec watching gulf war developments
  the european community (ec) should
  watch very carefully for any developments in the gulf war and
  their consequences on the oil market, ec energy commissioner
  nicolas mosar said today.
speaking two weeks after a u.s. warship was attacked in the
  gulf, mosar warned, "an escalation in the gulf would increase
  tensions in the oil market."
"but i do not want to be alarmist," he told a news conference
  after an ec energy ministers meeting in luxembourg.
he said the volume of ec oil imports from the gulf had
  declined to around 31 pct of total oil imports in the first
  three months of 1987 against 35 pct in the same period last
  year.
"there are also other potential sources of supplies in the
  world," he added.
the issue of gulf oil imports was not discussed at the
  ministers' meeting, he added.
a ec committee of national experts in the so-called oil
  supply group would discuss gulf oil supplies at their bi-annual
  meeting on june 19, he said.
but any major decisions would have to be reserved for ec
  foreign ministers, diplomats said.
west european nations have so far shown little enthusiasm
  for backing a u.s. plan to give military protection to merchant
  ships in the gulf which could help insure the safety of oil
  supplies.
ball corp &lt;bll> completes acquisition
  ball corp said it completed the
  purchase of privately held &lt;verac inc>, a san diego defense

  sales of about 23 mln dlrs.
verac will operate in san diego as part of ball's technical
  products group.
alberta seeding virtually complete
  ninety-six pct of alberta and
  northeastern british columbia crops have been seeded, about a
  week ahead of the 10 year average, according to the alberta
  wheat pool report.
hard red spring wheat accounts for most acreage with 6.0
  mln estimated for this year, little changed from last year.
oats acreage of 1.95 mln is unchanged on last year and barley
  area of 5.9 mln is also similar to last year.
rapeseed planting
  of an estimated 3.24 mln is expected five pct up on 1986.
the
  south and south central areas of alberta lacked moisture with
  germination patchy at best.
growth prospects in northern areas
  are generally in the good to very good range.
soil moisture is better in the north central and peace
  areas, the wheat pool said.
n.z.
april current account deficit narrows
  new zealand's current account deficit
  narrowed to 76 mln n.z.
dlrs in april from a revised 89 mln
  dlrs in march, and 224 mln dlrs in april 1986, in a smoothed
  seasonally-adjusted measurement, the statistics department
  said.
the march figure was revised from 69 mln dlrs.
the department said in a statement seasonally adjusted, but
  non-smoothed figures, showed a deficit of 99 mln dlrs against
  76 mln dlrs in march and 230 mln dlrs in april 1986.
totally unadjusted figures show a deficit of 83 mln dlrs
  against 164 mln dlrs in march, revised from 178 mln dlrs, and
  compared with 262 mln in april 1986.
the smoothed seasonally adjusted series shows a surplus on
  merchandise trade of 145 mln dlrs against 135 mln dlrs in march
  and 30 mln dlrs in april 1986.
seasonally adjusted but non-smoothed figures show a
  merchandise trade surplus of 132 mln dlrs against a 148 mln dlr
  surplus in march and a 14 mln dlr surplus in april 1986.
unadjusted merchandise figures show a surplus of 151 mln
  dlrs against a 5.0 mln dlr (revised from 10 mln dlr) deficit in
  march and a 31 mln dlr deficit in march 1986.
the smoothed seasonally adjusted deficit on invisibles was
  234 mln n.z.
dlrs against 236 mln dlrs in march and 255 in
  april 1986.
the seasonally adjusted but non-smoothed deficit on
  invisibles was 240 mln dlrs against 229 mln dlrs in march and
  245 mln dlrs in april 1986.
the unadjusted deficit on
  invisibles was 234 mln dlrs against 158 mln dlrs, revised from
  168 mln dlrs, in march and 231 mln dlrs in april 1986.
seasonally adjusted export and import figures were not
  available.
the department said these figures show a continuing
  improvement in the current account deficit, caused mainly by an
  improvement in the balance on merchandise trade which has now
  being in surplus since november 1985.
strong demand for peru bismuth in jan/may
  very strong demand from all markets
  including, recently, japan has resulted in peru's bismuth
  exports showing an impressive increase in january/may 1987,
  peru's state owned mining industry's marketing arm minpeco s.a.
  said.
in a statement released by its london office, minpeco said
  peruvian customs figures for bismuth exports for the first five
  months were 574.8 tonnes compared with 160.7 tonnes in the same
  period of 1986 and 483.4 tonnes during the whole of 1986,
  minpeco said.
a breakdown of the figures showed peru exported 296.4
  tonnes of bismuth to the u.s. during jan/may 1987 compared with
  127.0 during the whole of 1986.
other recipients were peoples
  republic of china 110.4 (100.0), holland 100.2 (150.0), ussr
  50.0 (50.0) and other areas 17.8 tonnes (56.4).
sales to the u.k., west germany, france and other western
  and eastern european countries are hidden under the heading
  holland as minpeco sells to customers in these countries from
  stocks the company normally holds in rotterdam, the statement
  said.

u.s. meat industry launches campaign in japan
  the u.s. meat industry has launched an
  aggressive promotion campaign in japan to increase consumer
  awareness of u.s. beef and persuade the japanese government to
  relax current beef import quotas.
u.s. beef sales to japan, currently around 480 mln dlrs
  annually, could increase to over two billion dlrs and as high
  as six billion dlrs by the year 2000 if japanese quotas were
  removed and the japanese consumer were made more aware of the
  attributes of u.s. beef, officials of the u.s. meat export
  federation said at a press conference today.
partially funded with a 6.5 mln dlr award made through the
  agriculture department's targeted export assistance (tea)
  program, a five-year meat promotion campaign in japan was
  launched by the u.s. meat export federation in april.
"the promising japanese beef market could be one of the
  bright spots for u.s. agricultural exports," said philip seng,
  asian director for the federation.
"we supply and they (japan)
  buy a very high quality of beef.
they like our beef and want to
  buy more," he said.
seng pointed to japan's beef quota system, which limits
  total japanese beef imports to 177,000 tonnes per year and u.s.
  imports to 58,400 tonnes, as the major constraint in expanding
  u.s. beef shipments to japan.
the quotas were implemented in 1977 at a time of heavy
  japanese foreign beef imports.
the current quota agreement
  expires next march and beef quota negotiations are set to get
  underway this fall.
the reagan administration has called for an end to the
  quotas by april, 1988, but japanese officials have said they
  would not liberalize imports regardless of the u.s. pressure.
officials from the meat export federation told reuters that
  they do not expect a complete lifting of the quota, but that
  they hope for at least a gradual increase in the quota.
high beef prices in japan caused by the protected market
  has also kept beef consumption at modest levels, meat industry
  officials said.
japanese shoppers pay an average of 27.14 dlrs for a u.s.
  tenderloin steak in a restaurant and an average of 47.42 dlrs
  for a japanese-produced restaurant steak, the meat association
  said.
at the retail level, u.s. striploin sells for 9.77 dlrs
  per pound, while japanese beef sells for 28.51 dlrs per lb.
japanese consumers currently eat less than 10 lbs of beef
  per year, compared to 78 lbs for the average american,
  officials said.
total beef consumption in japan is now 700,000 to 800,000
  tonnes per year, but seng said with the removal of quotas and a
  decrease in beef prices, consumption could increase to 3.2 mln
  tonnes.

merchants &lt;mchn.o> to report 2nd qtr loss
  merchants national corp, with 3.7

venezuelan aluminum firm to credits
  the venezuelan state aluminum company
  venalum is negotiating a total of 123.9 mln dlr in credits from
  abroad for a planned expansion of production faciities, finance
  minister manuel azpurua said.
azpurua spoke to reporters after meeting representatives of
  the kreditanstalt fur wiederaufbau (kfw) bank of germany, who
  tommorrow will sign a agreement to grant 100 mln marks (54.9
  mln us dlrs) in credits to venalum.
the agreement will have an eight and one-half year term and
  a fixed interest rate of 6.13 pct.
azpurua said venalum is negotiating credits of 14.9 mln
  dlrs from the swiss bank corporation, 14 mln dlrs from
  mitsubishi of japan and 40 mln dlrs from eksportfinans of
  norway.
"this proves we are achieving our goal of reestablishing
  the financial flows to the country," said azpurua.
the credits would go to the installation of a fifth
  production line in venalum, one of three state aluminum
  companies, which produces primarily for the export market.
u.s. house passes mideast gulf bill
  the house today approved a bill
  requiring the reagan administration to report to congress on
  its mideast gulf policy but not restricting its actions.
the vote in favor was despite a last-minute revolt by an
  alliance of liberal democrats and conservative republicans who
  sought to defeat it as a signal that a growing number of
  legislators oppose president reagan's policies in the region.
in the senate, a leading republican senator, former senate
  appropriations committee chairman mark hatfield of oregon, said
  he would try to prevent consideration of the bill.
he said he will put a so-called "hold" on the bill until he
  finds out whether the war powers act applies to protecting
  kuwaiti tankers.
congressional leaders complain they were not consulted
  about plans to put the u.s. flag on kuwaiti ships and some
  charged the policy could lead the u.s. into the iran-iraq war.
conservative republicans said increasing the u.s. military
  obligation in the gulf would place impossible burdens on
  american servicemen and equipment, and warned it could lead to
  war.
"it is a real snake pit at best and a powder keg that will
  blow sky-high at worst," said wisconsin rep. toby roth.
near term strength seen for currency futures
  currency futures are likely to move
  higher following the sharp rally today after president reagan
  announced that paul volcker would not accept a third term as
  federal reserve chairman and that alan greenspan was nominated
  as his replacement, currency analysts said.
contrary to predictions before the volcker resignation,
  analysts are calling for higher currency futures prices between
  now and the june 8 venice economic summit.
in particular, uncertainty about greenspan's attitude to
  the dollar could undermine sentiment toward the u.s. currency,
  analysts said.
greenspan said today that the dollar appeared to be nearing
  a bottom, but the market will bear in mind his remarks in
  chicago last week that the dollar's recent move upward was a
  technical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower,
  analysts said.
"disappointment of european central bankers over the
  appointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollar
  lower," said manufacturers hanover futures vice president carol
  mackoff.
"the international community will not like this
  appointment," as it suggests the possibility that the u.s.
  budget deficit is too much of a burden on monetary policy and
  that volcker was unable to get the commitment he sought to
  reduce the deficit, added merrill lynch economics analyst david
  horner.
furthermore, "that greenspan was not named two months ago
  suggests that he was not the administration's first choice --
  and that the status of his appointment was as a bridesmaid,"
  horner said.
a declining dollar scenario with higher currency futures
  prior to and throughout the venice meetings would be mitigated
  only by concrete action as opposed to "jawboning" at the g-7
  summit, he said.
but g-7 finance ministers, judged by recent statements, may
  be at an impasse, analysts said.
japan and west germany today reiterated that neither
  planned further interest rate cuts, despite pressure from the
  u.s. to do so, mackoff said.
the u.s., on the other hand, has not cut its budget deficit
  as japan and west germany have urged, she said.
should g-7 members force a u.s. commitment to cut its
  budget deficit in the next two years, a further decline in the
  dollar could be forestalled, horner said.
however, "the impact from venice will be nothing if nothing
  changes," horner said.
smith barney, harris upham and co. analyst craig sloane
  said european currencies will likely move to the higher end of
  their 1987 ranges after today's sharp advance.
for the next two weeks, sloan calls for september yen
  futures to advance toward the 0.007200 area.
he said september
  marks could close in on 0.5700 as an upside target, while swiss
  francs could climb to a range between 0.6900 and 0.6950.

s. korean wholesale prices up 0.4 pct in may
  south korea's wholesale price index, base
  1980, rose 0.4 pct to 127.0 in may after a 1.1 pct rise in
  april and was 1.5 pct higher than in may 1986, the bank of

the may consumer price index, which has the same base, rose
  1.4 pct to 149.1 after a 0.3 pct gain in april, for a
  year-on-year rise of 3.5 pct.
wholesale prices rose 2.0 pct in the first five months of
  1986, while consumer prices rose by 3.2 pct.
bank officials
  said the rises were due to a strong yen which made imports of
  japanese parts, raw and intermediary materials more expensive.

nakasone says dollar fall only temporary

citibank lowers australian prime rate to 16 pct

australian prime rates have now retreated from a recent

citibank said its reduction reflected the decline.
china moves to stabilise world tungsten prices
  china is moving to stabilise world prices
  of tungsten after fluctuating prices this year affected the
  country's export earnings, the china daily said.
the paper quoted industry officials as saying they would
  fix export prices on the basis of the world market, stop
  smuggling and encourage producers to reduce exports.
current world prices range from 49 to 55 dlrs per tonne
  unit, but china suffered heavy losses when the price slumped to
  39 dlrs earlier this year, it said.
some 45 pct of world tungsten exports come from china, but
  the country imports high-grade tungsten products.
australia's ansett to take 20 pct of america west
  australia's &lt;ansett airlines> will
  exercise an option to acquire 20 pct of america west airlines
  inc &lt;awal.o> for about 31.5 mln u.s. dlrs, &lt;ansett transport
  industries ltd> managing director peter abeles said.
exercise, involving the purchase of about three mln new
  america west shares for 10.50 u.s. dlrs each, was scheduled to
  be finalised in july or august, he said in a statement.
abeles said ansett would become the largest single
  shareholder in what he said was the fastest growing airline in
  the united states.
america west is based in phoenix, arizona.
under the terms of the option agreement, ansett would have
  the right to maintain its 20 pct position in the event of
  future stock sales, but could not go beyond 20 pct unless so
  requested by america west, abeles said.
america west would retain the right of first refusal if
  ansett offered any of the shares for sale.
in addition, ansett would gain one board seat, he said.
ansett transport industries wholly owns ansett airlines,
  one of australia's two major domestic airlines, and is in turn
  owned 50/50 by abeles' international transport group tnt ltd
  &lt;tnta.s> and rupert murdoch's news corp ltd &lt;ncpa.s>.
japan foreign shipbuilding orders fall in may
  new foreign shipbuilding orders received

  exporters association said.
the backlog of orders at end-may was 122 ships of 3.70 mln
  gt against 125 ships of 3.73 mln at end-april and 233 ships of
  5.99 mln a year ago, an association official said.
the world shipping recession and the yen's appreciation
  against the dollar depressed may orders, he said.
shultz predicts rapid narrowing of u.s. trade gap
  secretary of state george shultz said
  the u.s. would erase its large foreign trade deficit faster
  than many predicted, and the consequences for its trade
  partners might be traumatic.
"the u.s. economy will inevitably make the adjustment
  necessary to move from a deficit to a surplus trade balance in
  order to service our growing foreign debt," he told a conference
  attended by the six members of the association of southeast
  asian nations and their leading western friends.
"in my view, this will happen more rapidly than many
  observers now predict."
"the universal strategy of aggressive export-led growth is
  becoming less effective," shultz said.
"it is not arithmetically possible for every country in the
  world to be a net exporter at the same time.
the u.s. deficit,
  which we all decry, has been in a sense the place into which
  everyone's export-led strategy for growth has gone."
"the huge surpluses of japan and (west) germany have fed on
  this deficit, so something will have to give and it will be
  possibly a traumatic experience," he added.
"while you must keep up the pressure on us to eschew
  protectionist policies, you must act too," shultz said.
"i can do a better job of convincing the congress to leave
  our door open to imports if more of our trading partners open
  their doors wider," he told the group, which included
  representatives from australia, canada, japan, new zealand and
  the european community.

japan 1986/87 compound feed output up 2.3 pct
  japanese compound feed output rose 2.3 pct
  to 25.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ended march 31 from 25.23 mln a
  year earlier, the agriculture ministry said.
the marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand for
  poultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beef
  cattle raising, ministry officials said.
compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87
  against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-march stocks were
  217,554 tonnes against 224,101.
corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnes
  from 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.
the officials said corn imports rose because the world
  surplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reduced
  chicago prices.
the corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in
  1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.
sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87
  from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from
  18.9 pct because of greater corn use.
higher import prices due
  to poor harvests last year in major producing nations such as
  argentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.
soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln and
  the compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.
the drop in soybean meal consumption resulted from
  increased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.
rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against
  528,152 a year earlier.
the compounding ratio rose to 2.2 pct
  from 2.1 pct.

commonwealth bank cuts australian split prime
  the commonwealth bank of australia said
  it will lower its reference rate for loans to 15.75 pct from
  16.25 pct and its overdraft reference rate to 16.25 pct from
  16.75, effective june 24.
bank officials have said the bank regards the overdraft
  reference rate, based on short-term rate trends, as its key
  prime lending rate to corporate customers.
the loan reference
  rate is based on longer term trends.
the bank is the latest to cut prime rates in recent days
  following a continuing decline in market rates.
other prime
  rates now range from 16 pct to 17.5 pct.
australia to produce silver and platinum coins
  the australian government has given
  support in principle to the production of platinum and silver
  bullion coins at the perth mint, treasurer paul keating said.
this followed the success of the australian nugget gold
  bullion coins launched this year, he said in a statement.
he said that, as with the australian nuggets, the coins
  would be legal tender.
the platinum coins would be made in four
  weights but the silver coin would be of one ounce weight.
he said detailed arrangements for their issue would be
  finalised after talks between the federal authorities and the
  western australian government, owner of the perth mint.
s.korea sees gnp growth more than 10 pct this year
  south korea's gross national product (gnp)
  will exceed 10 pct real growth this year and the won will rise
  further as long as the current account surplus continues to
  widen, deputy prime minister chun in-yong told reporters.
chung, who is also minister of economic planning, said his
  gnp estimate was based on the assumption that the economy will
  remain stable.
the official target for 1987 gnp growth is eight pct.
gnp rose 15.6 pct between the first quarters of 1987 and
  1986, according to provisional bank of korea figures.
gnp rose 12.5 pct in calendar 1986.
in the first four months of this year, the current account
  swung to a surplus of 2.5 billion dlrs from a deficit of 294
  mln dlrs in the same 1986 period.
"what the minister said does not imply any major economic
  policy change," a ministry spokesman told reuters.
"but he tried
  to urge business circles to prepare for the forseeable economic
  (future) ... a high won era."
south korean manufacturers, who have insisted the won
  should not rise more than seven pct this year, have said they
  plan to ask the government to slow down its appreciation
  against the dollar.
the bank of korea today quoted the won unchanged at 812.05
  against the dollar, a 6.02 pct gain so far this year compared
  with a 3.34 pct increase for the whole of 1986.
the won strengthened by 6.60 won to the dollar in three
  days earlier this month while an international monetary fund
  team held talks here to discuss revaluation.
australian crude output falls in first nine months
  australian crude oil and condensate
  output fell 7.6 pct to 23,480 megalitres, or about 147 mln
  barrels, in the first nine months of fiscal 1986/87 ending june
  30, the department of resources and energy said.
the decline in production in the nine months to end-march
  reflected mainly a sharp dip early in the fiscal year, when low
  oil prices and high marginal excise rates led to a reduction of
  output from bass strait, department figures in its major energy
  statistics publication show.
a megalitre is 6,290 barrels.

government to sell 25 pct of air new zealand
  the new zealand government will sell
  25 pct of state-owned &lt;air new zealand ltd> to the public,
  civil aviation minister richard prebble said.
prebble said in a statement the government would appoint an
  adviser to help it decide how the shares should be sold, the
  timing of any sales and the price.
"clearly there will be a need to gauge the effect of other
  proposed share issues so as to enter the market at the best
  opportunity," prebble said.
"we are in no particular rush to sell our shares in air new
  zealand," he said.
"our aim is to maximise the benefit to the taxpayer.
if that
  means waiting for a while, then so be it," prebble said.
he said air new zealand expects to release its results soon
  for the year to march 31 1987.
he said he was confident it
  would post an excellent profit.
prebble said air new zealand was successful but its ability
  to prosper in future was hampered by its
  wholly-government-owned status.
prebble said access to new sources of capital would
  increase its ability to expand and develop.
this sale announcement follows the public float in march of
  around 13 pct of the &lt;bank of new zealand ltd>.
the government has said it will also float part of the

toshiba, sharp restrain lap-top pc exports to ec
  toshiba corp &lt;tsba.t> and sharp corp
  &lt;shrp.t> decided to maintain exports of lap-top personal
  computers to the european community (ec) at last year's levels,
  despite the halt of shipments to the u.s., company spokesmen
  told reuters.
they said the voluntary restraints were aimed at averting
  ec sanctions urged by european computer makers.
the europeans
  feared japanese personal computers would flood ec markets after
  washington imposed 100 pct tariffs last april.
toshiba and sharp together control about 40 pct of the
  personal computer market in the ec, the sharp spokesman said.
toshiba said exports of t1100 and t3100 lap-top computers
  would continue at 5,000 units a month for the time being.
sharp said exports to the ec of pc 7000 series lap-top
  personal computers would continue at last year's level of
  12,000 to 16,000 units a year.
washington imposed the tariffs because of japan's alleged
  failure to uphold a 1986 agreement on semiconductor trade.
belgium cuts treasury certificate rates
  the belgian national bank said it cut
  one, two, and three month treasury certificate rates, all by
  0.10 points, effective immediately.
the cuts take the one month rate to 6.75 pct, the two month
  rate to 6.80 pct and the key three month rate to 6.85 pct, the
  central bank said in a telex.
a national bank spokesman said the modest cut was made
  after a decline in domestic money market rates yesterday, and
  was not expected to be followed by a cut in the 7.60 pct
  discount rate.
the short-term treasury certificate rates, and especially
  the three-month rate, have been the national bank's main
  monetary policy instrument for the last two years.
the discount rate has been the market's penalty rate rather
  than a guiding rate since 1985, and its advances are currently
  little used as liquidity is ample, bank economists said.
the bank last cut one- to three-month certificate rates on
  june 5, also by 0.10 points.
arab heavy term crude supplies to japan up in july
  &lt;aramco corp> has accepted japanese
  nominations to lift a higher proportion of arab heavy crude oil
  under term contracts in july, oil industry sources said.
japanese companies requested a ratio of 80 pct arab heavy
  to 20 pct arab light under a term contract agreement with
  aramco for 100,000 barrels per day, the sources said.
the
  contractual ratio is 30 pct heavy crude to 70 pct light.
japanese demand for heavy crude oil has increased
  substantially since the all japan seaman's union ceased sailing
  into the northern mideast gulf last month, causing problems
  with liftings of heavy kuwait and khafji crudes.
indonesia cuts july crude supplies to japan
  indonesia's state oil company, pertamina,
  has informed its affiliated japanese companies that crude oil
  supplies will be 40 pct less than contractual volumes in july,
  a spokesman for an affiliated company said.
he said the allocations were in line with indonesia's
  production ceiling under its current opec quota, so they might
  be increased if opec ratifies a production rise next week.
allocations of indonesia's main traded crude, minas, had
  been cut by 50 pct and duri by 38 pct, he said.
last month contractual volumes were cut by 30 pct.
contractual volumes assume no production ceiling.
oil traders said indonesian grades were already trading
  above their official selling prices (osp) on the spot market
  due to strong demand from japan and the u.s. and tight
  supplies.
a cargo of duri loading in july was reportedly traded
  yesterday at 70 cents over its osp of 15.60 dlrs per barrel and
  minas is trading about 20 cents higher, they said.
french official reserves 420.50 billion francs in may vs

  french official reserves 420.50 billion francs in may vs
  420.24 billion april - official
french official reserves rise in may
  french official reserves rose 258 mln
  francs in may to 420.50 billion francs from 420.24 billion at
  the end of april, the finance ministry said.
the slight rise partly reflected the repayment last month
  of france's outstanding 11.95 billion francs of debt owed to
  the european monetary cooperation fund (fecom).
it also reflected a negative 314 mln franc position with
  france's exchange stabilisation fund after intervention
  purchases of 10.6 billion francs during may.
foreign currency holdings fell 7.28 billion francs to
  124.58 billion while ecu holdings fell by 5.55 billion francs
  to 58.52 billion due to the repayment of part of france's debt
  owed to the fecom and stabilisation fund operations, the
  ministry said.
claims on the imf rose 1.14 billion francs to 18.97
  billion, including a 385 mln franc increase in france's reserve
  position with the imf and a 751 mln franc rise in holdings of
  special drawing rights.
gold holdings were unchanged at 218.46 billion francs.
french state sell-offs raise 52 billion francs
  the french government's privatisation
  program, which began late last year, has earned the french
  state about 52 billion francs to date, the finance ministry
  said.
sources close to finance minister edouard balladur said the
  revenues raised from the privatisation program would be used in
  priority to pay off public debt, which stood at 398.2 billion
  at the end of 1986.
the ministry said in a communique that the returns included
  banking group societe generale &lt;sgen.pa>, which began its
  two-week public flotation last monday.
the government has carried out eight flotations, as well as
  the private sale of telephone group &lt;cie generale de
  constructions telephoniques> (cgct) since its denationalisation
  scheme began last december with the sell-off of glass makers
  saint-gobain &lt;sgep.pa>, it added.
the government has pledged to privatise 66 state-owned
  industrial, banking and insurance companies by 1991.
other companies to be sold to the private sector in the
  near future are television network tf-1 later this month and
  banking group cie financiere de suez &lt;fspp.pa> in the autumn.
the ministry said tf-1's forthcoming sell-off meant that a
  third of the government's programme would have been completed
  in less than nine months.
balladur on sunday rejected press and opposition charges
  that the share prices for privatised companies had been pitched
  too low.
he said that the average premium of shares trading on the
  bourse was between 15 and 30 pct over their offer price.
this
  compared with premiums of between 60 and 80 pct on similar
  share flotations in britain.
fiji makes sugar payment to get harvest started
  fiji sugar farmers will receive an interim
  payment on the 1986 crop, four months ahead of schedule, in a
  move aimed at getting harvesting of the drought-hit 1987 crop
  under way, governor-general ratu sir penaia ganilau said.
industry sources said latest forecasts for the 1987 crop
  indicated output of 360,000 tonnes, well down on the record
  501,800 tonne tel quel production in the 1986 (may-december)
  crop year.
the previous record was set in 1982 when fiji produced
  486,790 tonnes.
for the past month fiji sugar farmers have delayed
  harvesting the 1987 crop pending a response from the
  governor-general to demands following the may 14 coup.
ganilau said in a statement the fiji sugar corp would make
  a payment of five dlrs per tonne against the final payment for
  the 1986 crop on the understanding that preparations by growers
  for commencement of harvesting would be completed at all mills
  by june 23.
crushing would commence at labasa and penang mills on june
  23 and at lautoka and rarawai mills on june 30, he said.
the interim payment, to be made on or about june 30, is the
  full amount of the grower's share of 1986 sugar proceeds
  received to-date.
the balance will be paid in october.
growers had also called for the full 1987 forecast price of
  23.50 dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery to
  the mill, but this has been rejected by the state controlled
  fiji sugar corp, ganilau said.
however, in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of
  14.10 dlrs, an additional sum of 2.35 dlrs, or 10 pct of the
  forecast price, would be paid on december 15, on all cane
  harvested by november 30, he said.
ganilau said, "this will be at least one month in advance of
  the expected date of payment of the second payment of cane.
the
  balance of the second payment will be made six weeks after the
  end of crushing."
another demand of fiji's 22,000 small farmers was that an
  estimated 14 mln dlr loan from the fiji development bank (fdb)
  for the 1983 cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off.
the fdb rejected this request.
ganilau said, however, "the bank is prepared to carefully
  consider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases of
  hardship on a case-by-case basis."
in response to a further demand that all soldiers be
  removed from the cane growing areas, ganilau said the army
  would restrict its presence in the cane areas.
he said he had directed the authorities to issue permits to
  harvesting gangs, cane growers and sugar industry trade unions
  to hold the necessary meetings in preparation for the
  commencement of harvest.
senior representatives of the sugar cane growers had
  indicated a desire to commence the crush as soon as possible,
  he added.

u.k. unemployment falls below three mln in may
  u.k. unemployment fell a record
  provisional, seasonally-adjusted 64,300 in may to a total 2.95
  mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, the employment department
  said.
in april, seasonally-adjusted unemployment fell by an
  upwardly revised 21,600 to 3.02 mln or 10.9 pct, it said.
the unadjusted jobless total in may, including school
  leavers, alos fell a record 121,000 to 2.99 mln or 10.8 pct
  from april's 3.11 mln, 11.2 pct.
may was the eleventh successive decline from a peak last
  summer of 11.6 pct, the employment department said.
"unemployment has fallen to under three mln for the first
  time in over three years.
the may fall of 64,000 was the
  largest drop since records were first kept (in 1948),"
  employment minister norman fowler said.
all regions have seen above average falls in long term
  unemployment during the past year, he added.
the last time the adjusted total of unemployed was below
  three mln was july 1984, while the unadjusted total was last
  below this level in june 1983.
u.k. earnings up underlying 7.75 pct in april
  u.k. average earnings rose a seasonally
  adjusted 6.5 pct in the year to end-april, after increasing by
  6.7 pct annually in march, the employment department said.
the april index, base 1980, was set at a provisional,
  seasonally-adjusted 197.3, up from 194.8 in march.
but the underlying rise was 7.75 pct, up 0.25 pct from
  march and back to the same level seen late last year.
the underlying rise is adjusted for factors such as
  back-pay and timing variations.
unit wage costs in u.k. manufacturing industry rose one pct
  in the year to april, after an upward revised rise of 0.7 pct
  in the period to march, the department of employment added.
in the three months to end-april, such costs were 0.9 pct
  higher, year-on-year, compared with a rise of 1.2 pct in the
  three months to march.
manufacturing productivity in april was 6.1 pct higher than
  a year ago after a downward revised 6.8 pct increase in march.
in the last three months period manufacturing productivity was
  up 6.7 pct, having increased 6.5 pct in the first quarter.
taiwan to reopen tender for u.s. soybeans
  the joint committee of taiwan's soybean
  importers will reopen a tender tomorrow for two shipments of
  54,000 to 66,000 tonnes of u.s. soybeans, a committee spokesman
  told reuters.
the committee rejected a tender today for a cargo of
  27,000 to 33,000 tonnes on the grounds the prices offered by
  the u.s.
suppliers were too high, he said.
the committee will be seeking a further shipment of between
  27,000 and 33,000 tonnes when it reopens the tender tomorrow,
  he added.
citibank lowers australian prime rate to 16 pct
  citibank ltd said it would lower its

other primes range from
  16.25 to 17.5 pct.
australian prime rates have now retreated from a recent
  peak of 19 pct in october in line with declining money market
  levels.
citibank said its reduction reflected the decline.
u.s.
senators propose ban on toshiba imports
  three u.s.

four sugar cargoes sold to china yesterday -trade
  four cargoes of raw sugar were sold to
  china yesterday via the london trade to supplement the
  country's current nearby buying programme, traders said.
the sugar was reported sold at around 160 dlrs a tonne c
  and f for july/august shipment or arrival in september, they
  said.
some traders said recent chinese purchases could total as
  much as 300,000 tonnes, but others, while agreeing a heavy
  volume had been taken, said an amount less than that figure was
  involved.
china was still believed to be in the market for more
  sugar, traders said.

dutch parliament backs stand against oils tax
  dutch parliamentary parties have
  re-affirmed their support for the government's opposition to
  the proposed european community tax on oils and fats,
  parliamentarians said.
a broad cross-section of members of parliament voiced their
  opposition to the tax during a debate in the lower house
  yesterday on the basis of possible retaliation from the u.s.
  and on the potentially damaging effect on third world
  countries.
state secretary for foreign affairs rene van der linden
  said the government was against the tax although it noted
  deepening ec financial difficulties.
"it is difficult to be against the tax and against extra
  finance.
the ec members have to make a choice," van der linden
  said.
however, he denied the government had dropped its
  opposition to the proposed tax or altered its position.

sandvik, diamant boart finalise drills merger
  sweden's sandvik ab &lt;svik.st> and
  diamant boart sa of belgium, in which societe generale de
  belgique &lt;belb.br> holds an indirect 52 pct stake, have
  finalised negotiations on merging oil and gas drilling tool
  activities, officials of both companies said.
staffan paues, president of the new brussels-based joint
  venture company diamant boart stratabit sa (dbs), told a news
  conference that the merged firm would be able to offer products
  for all types of drilling operations.
he said there were already signs that a slow recovery from
  recession was under way in the oil and gas industries.
"stability in oil prices should lead to renewed investment"
  paues said.
dbs, which paues said began operations today, brings
  together sandvik's wholly-owned u.s. subsidiary strata bit corp
  of houston and diamant boart's petroleum activities in europe,
  north america, the middle and far east and africa.
paues said the merger was a direct result of the sharp fall
  in oil prices 18 months ago which led oil firms to cut back
  exploration activities.
officials said the complementary
  character of the two firms' operations was a further reason.

vessel lost in pacific was carrying lead
  the 37,635 deadweight tonnes bulk carrier
  cumberlande, which sank in the south pacific last friday, was
  carrying a cargo which included lead as well as magnesium ore,
  a lloyds shipping intelligence spokesman said.
he was unable to confirm the tonnages involved.
trade reports circulating the london metal exchange said
  the vessel, en route to new orleans from newcastle, new south
  wales, had been carrying 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates.
traders said this pushed lead prices higher in early morning
  trading as the market is currently sensitive to any fundamental
  news due to its finely balanced supply/demand position and low
  stocks.
trade sources said that 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates
  could convert to around 5,000 tonnes of metal, although this
  depended on the quality of the concentrates.
a loss of this size could cause a gap in the supply
  pipeline, particularly in north america, they noted.
supplies
  there have been very tight this year and there is a strike at
  one major producer, cominco, and labour talks currently being
  held at another, noranda subsidiary brunswick mining and

jwt group &lt;jwt> sues wpp group plc
  jwt group inc said it filed a suit
  against &lt;wpp group plc> to enjoin the company from continuing
  its tender offer.
the company said it charged that former jwt group unit
  executive john peters has breached his fiduciary duty by
  disclosing confidential information about the company and its
  clients.
the company said the suit, filed in new york state supreme
  court, seeks to halt the "ongoing misuse and misappropriation
  of highly confidential and proprietary information concerning
  jwt and its clients.
the defendants in the suit are wpp group and its units and
  peters, who until january 29 was a director of j. walter
  thompson co, jwt group's main subsidiary and its president and
  chief operating officer.
jwt said it asked the court to enjoin the defendants from
  acquiring any further jwt stock, make them return all
  confidential and proprietary information and to disgorge all
  profits or other gains.
the company said it also asked the court to award jwt
  unspecified damages.
jwt group &lt;jwt> grants golden parachutes
  jwt group inc disclosed in a filing
  with the securities and exchange commission that it awarded
  so-called "golden parachutes" to 26 top officers.
the company said it granted the special bonuses, which take
  effect only if an executive is fired within two years of a
  successful takeover, on june 8.
it granted 25 of the officials a severance payment of just
  under three times their annual compensation if they are fired
  after a takeover.
for chairman don johnston, the payment was
  limited to twice his annual compensation.
jwt approved additional lump-sum payments of one year's
  compensation to an unspecified number of other highly paid
  company officials.
the company also altered its employee retirement and stock
  incentive plans, to assure continued protection and benefits
  for employees in the event of a hostile takeover.
the company did not disclose the cost of the changes made
  in the severance, retirement or stock plans.
unilever declines comment on gillette bid rumours

rpt - european trade may propose new ico formula
  european coffee traders and roasters
  may propose a new formula for calculating international coffee
  organization (ico) coffee quotas at the end of their meeting
  here this week, traders and officials told reuters.
although traders were unwilling to reveal details of the
  possible new formula, they said it would give brazil, the
  world's biggest coffee producer, unchanged ico quotas for the
  next two years and could be a basis for renegotiation.
"the main sticking point on quotas has been brazil's
  attitude, and this compromise could be a solution, " one said.
however, the european coffee trade federation meeting,
  which began here today and is to continue to the end of the
  week, has revealed gaps in the european position on
  re-introducing quotas.
traders said that, as a whole, the trade side was against
  re-introduction of ico quotas, while roasters were generally in
  favour with the single proviso that there had to be some
  formula basis for re-allocating quota shares among producing
  countries.
the roasters said the positions were generally fairly
  close, and problems with some government officials.
germany and italy were cited as the extremes of polarized
  government attitudes, with most other countries on the fence.
sources said germany was the most extreme against quota
  re-introduction, while the italians were most in favour.
"nevertheless, we expect to find enough common ground by the
  end of the week to at least present a common european community
  (ec) view at the next meeting of consumer members of the
  international coffee agreement (ica) in july," one trader said.
"we hope we can present the compromise proposal and that not
  only the consumer side, but the producer side will accept it,"
  one official said.
"we have learned that we can live without the quotas that
  were suspended in february last year, but would prefer the
  stability they can bring to the market as long as we do not
  simply return to the old and outdated status quo as far as
  quota allocation is concerned," he added.
overall, however, trader and roaster opinion on the
  likelihood of a successful re-negotiation was mildly
  pessimistic, varying between a 50-50 chance and 60-40 against.
"our main difficulty will be to persuade the u.s. on the
  consumer side and brazil on the producer side to agree to quota
  re-introduction, " he said.
"the u.s.
position has, if anything, hardened, while the new
  brazilian coffee institute president has adopted the least
  negotiable position of any of his predecessors," one trader
  said.
"however, with many producers starting to swing in favour of
  the consumer position that quotas have to be re-allocated under
  a new formula, brazil is becoming increasingly isolated, which
  gives at least some hope of a compromise at the ico quota
  meeting in september," the official said.

indonesia rejects world bank farm reform proposals
  indonesia rejected world bank
  recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, as
  the country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5
  billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.
agriculture minister achmad affandi, in written remarks
  distributed today as indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations met
  at the hague, said, "the general argument presented by the bank
  for this free trade, open economy view is weak."
the bank called for overhauls in how indonesia manages the
  largest farm area in south-east asia, and said agricultural
  growth was stagnating under subsisides for rice farming.
the bank report said indonesia's rice production had peaked
  and the subsidies are a waste of money.
affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides
  an income for 17 pct of the workforce.
the subsidies were
  needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,
  exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as
  assisting in small part the majority of indonesian farmers.
affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers
  should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the
  government would continue to maintain production targets for
  "strategic commodities" such as rice and sugar.
the bank report was especially critical of indonesia's
  drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double
  the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country
  would save money by importing the commodity.
however, affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need
  to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar
  industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.
he also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the
  agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry
  develop and because of "over-production and price intervention
  in the developed nations."

budget pact cuts u.s. farm funds 1.25 billion dlrs
  u.s. house and senate budget
  negotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reached
  yesterday, to cut 1.25 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spending
  on agricultural programs, congressional sources told reuters.
the agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4
  billion sought by the senate and one billion by the house.
the negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from the
  farm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for a
  total of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said.
the agreement presents the house and senate agriculture
  committees with difficult choices on how to make changes in
  agriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets
  without jeopardizing popular support payments, senior
  congressional aides told reuters.
some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find
  the budget savings.
rep. dan glickman, d-kan., chairman of the house grains
  subcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat
  and corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrs
  and 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.
house agriculture committee chairman kika de la garza has
  said the committee will consider the glickman proposal.
but congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to
  be approved because of opposition from republican lawmakers and
  a strong stance by agriculture secretary richard lyng, who said
  freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major
  grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget
  savings glickman claims.
another area where glickman and other have said budget
  savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program,
  arp, levels for wheat and corn.
however, on this issue also lyng has taken a strong stand
  within the reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 crop
  wheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30
  pct as sought by the office of management and budget, omb.
most
  commodity lobbyists expect lyng to prevail.
congressional sources said the only way to achieve
  significant budget cuts through arp increases would be to boost
  the 1988 corn arp.
but one informed congressional source said
  singling-out corn for an arp increase would would be seen as
  unfair to one commodity.
congressional sources said the areas where congress is most
  likely to eventually look for budget savings are some
  tightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible 
  adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.
those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billion
  but not enough, they said.
ultimately, congressional sources said the agriculture
  committees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on
  all commodity credit corp. payments to farmers, including price
  support loans and deficiency payments, similar to the
  gramm-rudman-hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.
this idea has been suggested by the american farm bureau
  federation, afbf, as the fairest approach for all commodities.
u.s. first time jobless claims rose in week
  new applications for unemployment

the number of people actually receiving benefits under

that was up from 2,255,000 the previous week.
opec differentials not seen posing major problems
  some opec states are unhappy about the
  prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose
  great problems when the group reviews its six-month-old price
  and output pact in vienna next week, oil analysts say.
they said nigeria, which holds the opec conference
  presidency, and qatar probably have the biggest grievances
  about price differentials making some of their crudes
  uncompetitive.
there has also been speculation by japanese traders that
  opec might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes,
  to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices.
but most experts agree that a major overhaul of price
  differentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market
  signals of a dent in opec's new unity.
"all opec members can make a good case for changing
  differentials," said one analyst with a major oil company.
"but
  at the end of the day, the attitude is going to be "leave well
  alone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered."
iran, libya and saudi arabia are among those who also saw
  sales problems earlier this year, traders say.
but diminished
  customer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,
  marketing incentives have helped their sales.
some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by
  means of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside
  better priced grades in a "package."
many opec crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least
  for some part of the year.
but many experts say opec should
  change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for
  fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades.
at
  its last meeting in december, opec agreed to reintroduce fixed
  prices from february 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference
  point.
official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985
  when members offered discounts to attract customers.
opec also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8
  mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter
  and 18.3 mln for the fourth.
analysts expect it will now extend
  or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.
spot market and netback values for some crudes do not
  mirror official prices, but opec will probably keep the 18 dlr
  target and at most make minimal changes to differentials,
  analysts say.
the 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six opec and one
  non-opec crudes.
opec assigned prices to its other key export
  crudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.
extra heavy crudes were among those left out.
industry estimates vary on the proportion of opec oil
  exports actually sold at official prices.
several experts say
  only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at
  official prices, with some of the rest included in processing
  or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.
problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,
  when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to
  pay the new prices.
nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich bonny light crude
  -- now opec's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --
  was uncompetitive on the spot market against britain's brent.
in february and march, nigeria's production shrank below
  its 1.238 mln bpd opec quota.
spot prices have since revived,
  due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has
  risen.
some experts feel bonny light is still overvalued and say
  its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.
but mehdi varzi, chief oil analyst with london's kleinwort
  grieveson securities, doubts nigeria will actively push the
  differentials question in vienna.
"it would not look good for opec unity if nigeria, which
  holds the presidency, raised the issue," he said.
new zealand budget forecast seen as positive
  analysts said they were surprised at
  the government's announcement of a forecast budget surplus for
  fiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policy
  statements and positive for the economy.
finance minister roger douglas predicted a budget surplus
  for the year ending march 1988 of 379 mln new zealand dlrs
  against a 1.95 billion deficit last year.
analysts polled by reuters said the forecast budget surplus
  was even more positive than the most bullish analysts'
  forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets.
market expectations among analysts questioned by reuters
  before the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a
  2.3 billion dlr deficit.
but none predicted a surplus.
the forecast initially looks positive for both the bond and
  the foreign exchange markets, one analyst said.
paradoxically,
  the new zealand dollar could rise in the medium term, despite
  lower interest rates, as overseas investors became more
  confident about investing in new zealand, he said.
however, some foreign exchange dealers disagreed, saying
  the local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and will
  move lower.
the local dollar dropped to 0.5940/50 u.s. dlrs in after
  hours trading, against 0.5970/77 just before the budget
  release.
analysts said the budget was also positive for the share
  market, despite an increase in the contribution of company
  taxation to revenue figures.
one equities analyst predicted that the budget surplus
  announcement could push the share market up by 50 points
  tomorrow.
the budget statement was broadly as expected, with a
  continuation of existing policies, and the absence of
  traditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positively
  by overseas investors, another said.
but one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-tax
  avoidance measures could damage some sectors of the share
  market, particularly multi-national companies.
the government is also lowering its borrowing requirements,
  through bond tenders, as a result of the surplus.
the
  requirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mln
  n.z.
dlrs from a predicted 1.75 billion.
predicted revenue in the budget looked sustainable and
  there appeared to be no holding back on expenditure, another
  economist said.
he added that the document seemed entirely
  credible.
"altogether it looks good for labour's election prospects,"
  he said.
an election is due before the end of september.

the company said it has also demanded repayment of a

indonesia rejects world bank farm reform ideas
  indonesia rejected world bank
  recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, as
  the country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5
  billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.
agriculture minister achmad affandi, in written remarks
  distributed today as indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations met
  at the hague, said, "the general argument presented by the bank
  for this free trade, open economy view is weak."
the bank called for overhauls in how indonesia manages the
  largest farm area in south-east asia, and said agricultural
  growth was stagnating under subsidies for rice farming.
the bank report said indonesia's rice production had peaked
  and the subsidies are a waste of money.
affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides
  an income for 17 pct of the workforce.
the subsidies were
  needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,
  exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as
  assisting in small part the majority of indonesian farmers.
affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers
  should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the
  government would continue to maintain production targets for
  "strategic commodities" such as rice and sugar.
the bank report was especially critical of indonesia's
  drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double
  the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country
  would save money by importing the commodity.
however, affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need
  to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar
  industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.
he also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the
  agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry
  develop and because of "over-production and price intervention
  in the developed nations."

charles cheleden, chairman and president of liberty
  financial and liberty savings, will continue as president and

peviously, lynch would have held about 25 pct, with becor

u.k. data depress rate cut outlook - analysts
  today's u.k. economic data have pushed
  the chances of another base lending rate cut from the current
  nine pct further into the distance, analysts said.
a record fall in unemployment and good manufacturing
  production data showed that the economy is still strong and
  does not need a fillip from lower rates.
news that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually,
  taken together with higher than expected bank lending and money
  supply growth, revived inflation worries and monetarist
  arguments against easier credit, they said.
"the timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed back
  all the while.
the strength of the economy and broad money
  growth are making it more difficult to see one in the near
  term," said chase manhattan securities economist robin marshall.
analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday's
  mortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societies
  said were a sign of the expected near term trend for u.k.
  rates.
it also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week that
  a post-general election cut was imminent, supported by such
  optimistic economic news as may's record reserves rise which
  mirrored the bank of england efforts to cap sterling's
  strength.
the gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasm
  about may's 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemployment
  rate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidly
  replaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlying
  average earnings in april, dealers said.
the upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lending
  rose 2.7 billion stg in may, above forecast, and that the bank
  of england looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offset
  the impact on domestic money supply of its current
  intervention.
"the gilt market reaction was correct," said bill martin,
  chief u.k.
economist at brokers phillips and drew.
"that's very important ...
it shows the economy in a very
  good state indeed," skeoch said.
"there's no reason to get worries about inflationary
  pressures because they're very subdued."
unit wage cost rises
  were better than expected, just one pct higher in the year to
  april, and it was these costs rather than average earnings
  which were potentially inflationary, he added.
"i don't think these average earnings numbers are a major
  problem," agreed chase manhattan's marshall.
but he said the gilts market was likely to remain worried
  about the funding implications of recent intervention.
he said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assets
  earlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes that
  the ruling conservatives would win last week's election, now
  looks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities try
  to prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system.
however, david owen, u.k.
economist at kleinwort grieveson
  securities, said any fresh sterling strength would still
  trigger a base rate cut and that today's figures did not signal
  higher inflation this year.
"wage increases are being offset by productivity growth.
as
  long as that continues we're okay," he added.
fed governor seger sees currency stability
  federal reserve board governor martha
  seger said there were signs of helpful stability in foreign
  exchange markets in recent weeks.
"i think we are beginning to see more calm in those markets,"
  seger told reporters after a speech to the u.s. league of
  savings institutions.
"i think it is very healthy when you can get into a period
  of stability," she said.
she said market forces have a major influence on exchange
  rates and said she did not know the right value for the dollar
  against the yen or the mark.
seger told the savings and loan executives that she was
  concerned about financial markets' absorption with exchange
  rate influences.
"i am concerned that we have gotten so nervous," about
  exchange rates, seger said.
she said the fed takes into account additional factors in
  determining monetary policy than the value of the dollar
  against other currencies.
on the economy, seger called the latest figures in gross
  national product a modest upward revision.
indonesia/turkey eligible for cattle under eep
  u.s. exporters will be able to sell

the company said that america west airlines inc &lt;awal.o>

the
  department of transportation had asked parties to submit
  statements by june 17 either supporting or opposing the

usair said it and piedmont again requested expedited

the company said the office of public counsel could find no

freedom federal &lt;frfe.o> seeks buyer

  1986 year end assets of about 733 mln dlrs.
"there is no assurance the bank will receive acceptable
  offers or be sold, but we feel this is a prudent step to take

arco &lt;arc> spin-off seen at 500 mln dlrs
  atlantic richfield co, considering a
  spin-off of a 20 pct interest in its chemical operations, could
  gain about 500 mln dlrs from the deal, industry analysts
  estimated.
yesterday arco's stock jumped as much as five points on
  rumors it was spinning off the chemical operations.
based on
  about 183 mln outstanding shares, the market in its frenzy was
  valuing the spin-off at about 900 mln dlrs, analysts said.
atlantic richfield, aware of the rumors, issued a statement
  around mid-day that it was considering a sale of only 20 pct of
  the unit, leading investors to take profits.
after the announcement, the company's stock retreated,
  closing at 93-7/8, up 1-3/8.
today it was off 1/4.
"it was a smaller deal than expected and somewhat
  disappointing," said analyst george baker at smith barney.
he
  said rumors of the spin-off had been around "for a couple of
  days."
baker said the unit was very profitable but it wasn't
  getting the type of exposure atlantic richfield sought, and its
  value was not reflected in the company's stock price.
industry analyst richard pzena of sanford c. bernstein said
  the unit had operating earnings of 132 mln dlrs last year and
  he expected it to earn about 175 mln dlrs this year.
based on a multiple of 17 times earnings--which pzena says
  chemical companies now sell for--the entire unit is worth about
  three billion dlrs, putting the 20 pct interest at around 500
  to 600 mln dlrs.
pzena said he thought the company was selling the stake
  because chemical margins had peaked, and he speculated the
  company would use the proceeds to pay down debt.
but he added the possibility remained the deal would fall
  through.
yesterday, arco said the proposal had not yet been
  presented to its board.
the chemical unit last year had revenues of 1.9 billion
  dlrs.

dutch consumers/industry see veg oils tax threat
  dutch consumers and food processors
  would be hit hard by the proposed ec tax on oils and fats, dick
  de bruyn, chairman of the commodity board for margarine, fats
  and oils, mvo, said at the annual meeting.
the dutch are the second largest consumers of margarine and
  fourth largest consumers of vegetable oils in the ec.
the fiercely contested tax would be a levy on consumers and
  steeply increase the costs of industries such as potato
  processing and cake and biscuit manufacturing, de bruyn said.
"a move by these industries to countries outside the ec
  cannot be ruled out," he added.
de bruyn said the tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats
  would be wide open to fraud, difficult to police, and hugely
  expensive administratively.
he also said the proposed tax contravened not only article
  three of the general agreement on tariffs and trade (gatt), the
  lome convention, and the united nations food and agriculture
  organization (fao) guidelines, but also the ec's own treaty.
the proposed tax would not only be inflationary but also
  have consequences for employment and investment, he added.

ec commission defends oils and fats tax
  a spokesman for the european
  community commission defended the controversial plan for a levy
  on oils and fats, saying that consumers would have to help
  alleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax.
norbert tanghe, head of division of the commission's
  directorate general for agriculture, told the 8th antwerp oils
  and fats contact days "the commission firmly believes that the
  sacrifices which would be undergone by community producers in
  the oils and fats sector ... would justify asking consumers to
  make an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem
  within that sector by paying a levy."
the proposed tax is necessary because the level of
  budgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds
  production has become unacceptable, tanghe said.
recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion european
  currency units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0
  billion ecus, he said.
in 1990 the community's "standstill"
  agreements with spain and portugal end and the ec would then
  feel the full impact of its enlargement.
the commission has proposed several cost and production
  cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum
  guaranteed quantity system, he added.
under the commission's system for stabilising consumer
  prices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700
  ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, tanghe
  said.
consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory
  amount when market prices are below or above this level.
he said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory
  amount would be used to finance the common agricultural
  policy's oils and fats regime.
"the commission believes that hostile reactions (to the
  proposed tax) have for the most part been based on incomplete
  or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal," he said.
tanghe said the proposed system conforms with general
  agreement on tariffs and trade, gatt, rules.
it would not be discriminatory because it would be applied
  to domestic and imported products, and past experience showed
  it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats.
ec-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do
  under present aid arrangements, he said.
the competitiveness between different oils, whether ec
  produced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantities
  imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax,
  tanghe said.
the proposed system would not alter the ec nations'
  requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall
  effect would stabilise community production levels without
  affecting demand, he said.
it is one of the proposal's objectives to maintain current
  import levels, he said.
imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are
  imported primarily to satisfy the ec's cakes and meals
  requirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system.
furthermore, more than half the oil produced from imported
  beans is re-exported to third countries, tanghe added.
union pacific &lt;unp> raises crude oil prices

u.k. court rules against rtz on oil field costs
  the u.k. high court dismissed an appeal
  by rio tinto-zinc corp plc's &lt;rtzl.l> rtz oil and gas ltd unit
  and ruled that the financial provisions a company makes for the
  future cost of abandoning an oil field are not tax deductible,
  the press association reported.
the company was appealing against a decision of the tax
  commissioners that any such provision was a capital
  expenditure, not a revenue expenditure, and was not deductible.
the court was told that since 1976 the company had made an
  annual provision of around 750,000 stg for the eventual cost of
  abandoning a rig.
an rtz spokesman said the ruling was not worrying as the
  subsidiary had assumed that the provisions were not deductible
  from corporation tax payable.
it would have been a bonus if the company had won but all
  budgeting had been on the assumption that it would not, he
  said.
oil analysts said that rtz's assumption of liability was
  shared by the industry as a whole.
the ruling appeared to mean that tax relief on the
  expensive process of abandoning rigs would apply when the
  expense occurred, not when provisions for future expenses were
  built into the accounts, one analyst added.

growth of palm oil use set to slow, output to rise
  the rate of increase in world palm oil
  use is likely to slow next season despite an expected 800,000
  tonne production rise to 8.13 mln tonnes, siegfried mielke,
  editor of the hamburg-based newsletter oil world said.
he told the 8th antwerp oils and fats contact days that in
  the next oct/sept 1987/88 season, palm oil use will rise to
  8.25 mln tonnes from 7.71 mln, below the five-year average
  increase of 550,000 tonnes.
opening stocks at the start of next october are expected
  to be about 1.4 mln tonnes, 300,000 tonnes below year-earlier
  levels, bringing total supplies to 9.5 mln tonnes, he said.
the anticipated total supplies will be about 500,000 tonnes
  above this season's available amount, mielke said.
the increase in mature palm tree areas in malaysia will
  slow down from this year on, but that will be offset by area
  expansion in indonesia, he said.
he estimated the combined rise in malaysian and indonesian
  mature area at 8.7 pct next year, after 9.5 pct this year, and
  at 6.7 pct in 1989 and 5.0 pct in 1990.
malaysia also is shifting plantings to sabah and sarawak,
  where the rate of expansion is higher than in the peninsula,
  but where yields are lower, he said.
the stocks/usage ratio of seven major oils is also
  expected to decline, mielke said.
the oils are soybean,
  cottonseed, sunflowerseed, coconut, rapeseed, palmkernel and
  palm.
at the start of october 1986 stocks of these oils were
  unusually high and represented 6.8 weeks of the current
  season's prospective demand, compared with six weeks a year ago
  and with 5.4 weeks in 1984, he said.
mielke expects the ratio to fall to 5.9 weeks by the start
  of next october and to the unusually low level of 5.4 weeks by
  the end of next season.
the stocks/usage ratio for palm oil was 11.4 weeks last
  october and is likely to be 8.7 weeks next october and 7.7 at
  the end of next season, mielke said.
world oilseed stocks also are expected to fall in the
  course of the next season, with the biggest reduction seen in
  soybean stocks, which mielke expects to decline by 5.0 mln
  tonnes or by one fifth.
almost all of the decline is expected to occur in the u.s.,
  for which he estimated ending stocks next season at 10.7 mln
  tonnes, or 393 mln bushels, against anticipated ending stocks
  of 15 mln tonnes, or 551 mln bushels, at the end of this
  season.
pan-alberta/united gas settlement approved
  pan-alberta gas ltd said its

  two-year interim contract amendment, cash payments and
  transportation credits for pan-alberta's customers, minimum
  yearly natural gas takes by united and a two-year commodity
  price.
united will pay pan-alberta producers about 50 mln dlrs

ecuador has trade surplus in first four months
  ecuador posted a trade surplus of 10.6 mln
  dlrs in the first four months of 1987 compared with a surplus
  of 271.7 mln in the same period in 1986, the central bank of
  ecuador said in its latest monthly report.
ecuador suspended sales of crude oil, its principal export
  product, in march after an earthquake destroyed part of its
  oil-producing infrastructure.

  mln dlrs and imports 628.3 mln, compared with 771 mln and 500
  mln respectively in the same period last year.

european community criticises u.s trade measures
  the european community (ec) accused the
  united states of violating a political commitment to free trade
  through practices including a tax on imported gasoline and a
  customs user fee.
ec ambassador tran van-thinh made the formal charge to the
  surveillance body of the general agreement on tariffs and trade
  (gatt), gatt spokesman david woods told reporters.
woods also said the ec was joined by the united states in
  criticising brazil for extending its list of products for which
  import licenses have been temporarily suspended, so as to
  improve its balance of payments.
the united states charged japan with violating gatt rules
  by restricting imports of agricultural products through an
  import licensing system.
the united states asked for
  consultations with tokyo on the issue.
tran charged that the trade measures contravened a
  political commitment to halt and reverse trade barriers,
  pledged by ministers in punta del este last september.
when ministers established the four year uruguay round to
  negotiate freer trade in 13 areas, they set up the gatt
  surveillance body to monitor this commitment, known in gatt
  jargon as "standstill and rollback."
tran criticised washington for the "superfund" tax on oil
  imports, a customs user fee, and the removal of a special
  machine tool (known as category fsc34) from its government
  procurement list for reasons of national security.
warren lavorel, a u.s. trade official, defended the
  policies, saying they did not violate gatt trade rules.
the surveillance body will send a record of today's talks
  to the trade negotiating committee, which oversees the round,
  to decide any further action on the charges.
the oil tax and customs user fee have already been the
  subject of formal gatt dispute panels set up outside the
  uruguay round to rule on the legality of the practices.
the ruling gatt council yesterday adopted a dispute panel's
  report and ruled that the u.s. superfund tax on oil imports
  breached trade rules.
it called on washington to modify its
  legislation.
mexico and canada, along with the european community,
  brought the dispute to the gatt last year.
dupont unit raises crude oil postings

zambian copper industry hopes for steady output
  zambia's copper mining industry is hoping
  to achieve and maintain production at over 500,000 tonnes a
  year in the next few years despite low world prices,
  deteriorating ores and shortages of mine inputs, industry
  officials said.
but zambia's decision to abandon last may 1 a tough
  international monetary fund (imf) economic recovery program has
  introduced an element of uncertainty into plans to restructure
  the ailing industry and boost profitability, they said.
copper production by the government-controlled zambia
  consolidated copper mines (zccm) for the 1987 financial year
  ended march 31 improved slightly to about 471,000 tonnes from a
  record 1986 low of 463,354 tonnes.
"we are convinced that by the end of the 1988 financial
  year, copper production could well be over 500,000 tonnes due
  to greater availability of spares and equipment," a zccm
  official said.
zccm officials said the production of cobalt, another
  strategic income earner, will also be tailored to meet demand.
finished production in 1986 was 4,565 tonnes, 911 tonnes
  higher than the previous year and the best production achieved
  to date.
protracted low world metal prices have badly hit the copper
  industry in zambia, the world's fifth biggest producer.
mining
  is monopolised by zccm and accounts for about 90 pct of the
  country's foreign exchange earnings.
production has also been seriously affected in recent years
  by equipment breakdowns, deteriorating ore and shortages of
  spare parts, fuel and lubricants.
the 463,354 tonnes output
  last year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700,000 tonnes.
a five-year production and investment plan launched in 1984
  by zccm is being funded by the european community, the african
  development bank and the world bank.
the plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining and
  metallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable.
zccm, the second largest employer after the government, has
  said it intends to lay off 20,000 of its 60,000 workforce as
  part of the plan.
more than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into the
  industry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability under
  the five-year restructuring plan.
company officials said although reserves were being
  depleted, zambia could continue to produce copper beyond the
  end of the century, though at lower levels of production.
industry sources said zccm's projected pre-tax profit for
  the financial year ended march 31 would be around 500 mln
  kwacha.
but with the current mineral export tax level being
  levied, a net loss is likely to be registered.
zccm recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 compared
  with a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before.
under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in
  1985, zccm's profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose as
  the value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just over
  two to the dollar.
but on may 1, president kenneth kaunda abolished the
  auctioning system, inspired by the international monetary fund,
  and announced zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economic
  strategy based on national resources.
zccm officials are still cautious over what effects the
  break with the imf will have on the industry's plans.
"we are still consulting to see how the new measures will
  affect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fare
  under the new situation," peter hansen, director of operations
  and third in the zccm hierarchy, told reuters.
some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchange
  rate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit zccm's export
  profits.
"most specialists i have talked to tell me the break-even
  point for zccm is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar," frederick
  chiluba, leader of the zambian congress of trade unions said.
high production costs continue to bedevil the zambian
  industry.
zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69
  cents per pound, compared with 55 cents in the united states
  and under 40 cents in chile.
the industry also faces transport problems due to zambia
  being landlocked.
the government confirmed this year it had
  stopped sbending copper south through south africa.
over 80 pct of shipments, some 35,000 tonnes a month, are
  sent by rail to the tanzanian port of dar-es-salaam, while
  5,000 tonnes go via zimbabwe to the mozambique port of beira.
transport has often been hit by shortages of wagons, spares and
  fuel.
rio de janeiro dockers strike over wages
  rio de janeiro's 3,500
  dockworkers went on strike for an indefinite period today to
  demand wage increases, a spokesman for the dockers said.
the rio dockers did not get support from their colleagues
  in santos, brazil's main port, but the spokesman said they
  would not return to work unless their demands were met.
earlier this week, some 65,000 dockworkers cancelled a
  scheduled national strike to pressure port officials to give
  them a wage increase and other benefits.
a rio port spokesman said the halt would cause daily losses
  of about 100,000 u.s. dlrs.

tanzania raises fuel prices,taxes in 1987/8 budget
  the tanzanian government, in its
  second annual budget since embarking on an economic recovery
  program inspired by the international monetary fund, announced
  increases in fuel prices and sales tax and higher levies on
  government services.
finance minister cleopa msuya said the government expected
  to spend 77.33 billion shillings in the financial year 1987/8,
  39 pct more than this year's estimate.
revenue would provide
  48.84 billion shillings, leaving a deficit of 28.49 billion to
  be financed through domestic and foreign loans.
this year's budget initially projected a deficit of only
  3.35 billion shillings but in mid-year the government had to
  impose new taxes to keep the deficit roughly on target.
no
  figure for the final deficit was avaialble.
the budget gave civil servants a 20 pct pay rise with
  effect from july 1, to compensate for inflation of more than 30
  pct.
msuya said regular petrol would go up 52 pct, with similar
  increases in the cost of premium and kerosene.
diesel would
  rise by 75 pct.
the higher levies affect official transactions such as road
  tolls, vehicle transfers and various licence fees, he added.

  its behalf last september.
an ibc spokesman told reuters that a 15 mln dlr loan from
  the banco do brasil would be used to pay five mln dlrs a month
  in june, july and august to creditors.
he said an auction of coffee would raise additional money
  and added that a reuter report on june 16 gave the wrong
  impression that the auction was necessary to raise part of the
  15 mln dlrs.
no date has yet been set for the auction.
magellan sets merger with balzac investments

u.s. said unfairly protecting defense industry
  britain's defence minister george younger
  said the u.s. was unfairly protecting its defence industry, and
  this could lead to british firms demanding counter-measures.
younger told a u.s. chamber of commerce meeting that u.s.
legislators were failing to realise "the true nature of the
  two-way street in terms of ideas, technology and equipment.
a british parliamentary report said that up to march
  british firms had been awarded just 34 mln dlrs worth of
  contracts for the strategic defence initiative, compared with
  the 1.5 billion dlrs britain had hoped to secure.
the committee said u.s. technology export restrictions and
  "selectiveness" towards foreign contractors had denied british
  competitors more lucrative orders and largely excluded them
  from technological research for sdi.
younger said london had given u.s. companies contracts
  under conditions of fair and open competition.
"all we ask is
  for our companies to be given similar opportunities," he added.
if new american legislation aimed at curbing unfair
  subsidies was used to exclude foreign suppliers it would not be
  surprising if british firms pressed for retaliatory measures,
  younger said.

pinnacle west capital &lt;pnw> buys mineral rights
  pinnacle west capital corp said

  uranium mining on about 21,000 acres in northern wyoming from
  westinghouns electric corp &lt;wx>.
the property is adjacent to a 34,000-acre site the company

both facilities are at expected to be in full
  operation in the early 1990s, with annual production of one to
  two mln lbs of uranium concentrates, the company said.
the new site is expected to produce about 250,000 lbs of

west texas cotton crop unscathed by storm
  the west texas cotton crop was largely
  unscathed by an isolated thunderstorm in that region last night
  that packed hurricane-force winds, crop and weather experts
  said.
"there might have been some isolated storms, but certainly
  nothing damaging," said charles stichler, an extension
  agronomist with the agricultural extension service in far west
  texas.
rumors of a damaging storm in west texas helped the new
  york cotton futures market rally sharply this morning.
cotton for december delivery was 1.35 cents higher at 70.95
  cents a lb at midsession after peaking this morning at 71.25
  cents.
"what happened is that the storm hit lubbock airport, and
  when that happens, everybody sees it," said dale mohler, a
  senior meteorologist with accu-weather inc.
      lubbock is the heart of the west texas cotton region, which
  produces about 80 pct of that state's crop.
the storm produced winds of about 75 mph.
"that's hurricane
  force.
but they were isolated to just a small portion of the
  west texas area, probably less than five pct," mohler said.
"no doubt there was some damage.
but if it had hit in july
  or august (when fruiting would be underway) it would have been
  worse," mohler said.
about 60 pct of the west texas cotton crop has been
  planted, and the remainder could be done by the weekend if
  weather remains hot and dry, stichler said.
the temperature in west texas since mid-week has been about
  95 degrees.
but a hot spell was sorely needed after far heavier
  than normal rainfall for several weeks, he said.

s. african union objects to planned matthey move
  a south african trade union is in
  dispute with a subsidiary of britain's johnson matthey plc over
  the company's proposal to move a platinum refinery near
  johannesburg to a black tribal homeland.
the 30,000-member mainly black chemical workers industrial
  union said it fears the planned move to the bophuthatswana
  homeland, where south african unions are not recognised, could
  lead to job losses and affect wages.
a mass dismissal last year at the impala platinum holdings
  ltd &lt;ipla.j> mines in the tribal homeland sent world platinum
  prices rocketing.
the union said talks with management over the proposed move
  had broken down.
it said an earlier ballot of refinery workers

  no final decision had been taken on strike action.
the refinery processes all platinum metals of rustenburg

bank of america sees slow u.s. consumer spending
  a trade-led boom in the u.s. is
  unlikely this year or next because growth in net exports will
  merely offset a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending and
  other sectors of the economy, bank of america said in its
  latest economic report.
although net exports will add 0.7 pct to gnp this year,
  after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending will
  contribute 1.4 pct less to gnp than it did last year.
as a result, gnp this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5
  pct, the same rate as last year, according to daniel van dyke,
  the bank of america economist who wrote the report.
"growth in consumer spending in the united states will drop
  dramatically this year because the jump in inflation will cause
  a falloff in the growth of disposable income," van dyke said.
growth in u.s. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8
  pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted.
the report was released before the commerce department
  reported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in may,
  after increasing 0.4 pct in april, and that personal
  consumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared with
  a 0.6 pct increase the month before.
the rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boost
  consumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9
  pct in 1986, bank of america forecast.
this rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income 
  growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986.
as a result, van dyke calculated that the purchasing power
  of an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrs
  this year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986.
the slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housing
  starts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in
  1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units.
"for the first time in several years, a recession in 1988
  or 1989 is more than a remote possibility," van dyke said.
currently, u.s. growth is fragile and depends heavily on an
  improvement in trade.
"however, with protectionist attitudes on
  the rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk," he
  added.
brooklyn union&lt;bu> seen hurt by pipeline closure
  brooklyn union gas co, a new york gas
  utility, will see its gas costs up sharply as a result of
  transco energy co's &lt;e> decision to close its pipelines to
  transport spot gas sales, energy industry analysts said.
brooklyn union, the fourth largest gas utility in the
  united states, purchased 36 pct of its supplies on the spot, or
  non-contract, market in 1986, and the proportion of spot
  supplies was estimated much higher in the five months of 1987,
  analysts said.
texas eastern pipelines &lt;tet>, the other competing
  pipeline, to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the south
  closed its gate station for summer, and brooklyn union has
  relied entirely on transco for spot supplies.
in the month of may, brooklyn union paid about two dlrs
  per mln british thermal unit for spot gas, while contract gas
  costs four to five dlrs per mln btu, industry sources said.
transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide open
  access to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fear
  of accumulating more take-or-pay liabilities.
take-or-pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers for
  gas even if delivery is not taken by its customers.
brooklyn union will continue receiving a small amount of
  supplies from minor fields under a grandfather clause, a
  brooklyn union official said.
foster corwith, gas analyst with dean witter reynolds, said
  most of the rising cost to booklyn union will be passed through
  to rate payers.
while net effect on the company will not be known for
  several months because of the time lag in deferred earnings,
  end-users, especially residential and commercial customers,
  will end up paying more for gas, he said.
because the closure takes place in summer months when gas
  demand is at seasonal low, the impact on cash flow would be
  small, curt launer, natural gas analyst with donaldson lufkin
  jenrette, said.
if the situation persists into winter heating season, high
  cost gas could cut in the company's profits, he said.
gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on transco for
  spot gas, such as north carolina natural gas co &lt;ncng>,
  piedmont natural gas co &lt;pny>, will face the same high cost
  factor as brooklyn union, steve richards, a supply manager with
  end users supply system, a houston based natural gas brokering
  firm, said.
"but these companies are not unwitting victims of the
  take-or-pay dispute between transco and producers," he said.
distributors have turned a deaf ear to transco's request
  for an inventory charge, which reserves the pipeline facility
  for spot gas to be delivered to these companies, he said.
without spot supplies, the high cost of system gas will
  threaten to drive away large customers capable of shifting to
  alternative fuels, he said.
in absence of any guidelines on inventory charges from the
  federal energy regulatory commission, the matter is being
  negotiated between pipelines and customers, richards said.
now that transco has refused to transport cheap spot gas
  for them, these distributors are likely to be more conciliatory
  on the inventory charge, he said.
"cool heads will prevail," dlj's launer said, " but it may
  take a while."
reynolds metals &lt;rlm> to restart idle potline
  reynolds metals co said it plans

  reynolds said, it will be operating at 100 pct of its
  consolidated primary aluminum capacity of 695,000 tonnes per
  year.
reynolds said work will commence on the potline restart in
  the near future and it is expected that actual metal production
  will begin on september one.
the company said the start up was necessitated by
  continuing strong demand for aluminum and dwindling worldwide
  inventories, and that the metal is needed to supply reynolds'
  various fabricating businesses.

itc contests use of documents as court evidence
  the international tin council, itc,
  intervened in a high court hearing in an attempt to prevent the
  presentation of internal council documents as evidence.
the intervention in shearson lehman's action against the
  london metal exchange over its "ring out" of tin contracts in
  1986 is likely to have implications for other cases in which
  the council is involved following the collapse of its buffer
  stock operations in october 1985, itc delegates said.
the itc's case is being presented by professor rosalyn
  higgins and is expected to take a further one or two days next
  week.
court does not sit tomorrow.
in essence the council is claiming that its status is
  similar to that of a foreign embassy and that its archives can
  therefore not be used in an english court of law.
the council ended its quarterly session today ahead of
  schedule.
the meeting had been expected to go on until tomorrow
  when the european community's legal advisers were due to
  attend, but delegates reviewed the progress of the various
  legal actions today.
otherwise, the meeting was occupied with internal
  administrative matters, delegates said.
the itc will continue to operate with a reduced staff after
  june 30 following the two year extension of the sixth
  international tin agreement.
as well as dealing with the ongoing litigation, the council
  will continue with its statistical work and carry out some
  research studies, although staffing in the research department
  is being cut to one from two previously.
at this week's session the council elected philip sparkes
  of australia as first vice-chairman for the producing members
  and heinz hofer of switzerland as second vice-chairman for the
  consumers for the year from july 1.
future quarterly sessions
  are scheduled for october 5/7 and december 14/16.

gillette &lt;gs> seen object of global bidding war
  ronald perelman, head of revlon group
  inc &lt;rev>, may be trying to ignite a bidding war for gillette
  co that could draw some big international players and in the
  process make a lot of money for himself, wall street analysts
  said.
several hours before a regularly scheduled board of
  directors meeting, gillette disclosed that perelman requested
  consent of its board for an offer of at least 40.50 dlrs per
  share.
perelman needed the consent because he agreed in
  november not to buy stock for 10 years without permission.
"i think ronald perelman is less interested in gillette and
  more interested in putting gillette into play because he stands
  to make a ton of money," said andrew shore, analyst at shearson
  lehman brothers inc. "in play" is a term used on wall street to
  describe what happens when a company becomes an unwiling
  takeover target.
shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement revlon
  gets paid if there is any acquisition of gillette through
  november of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs per
  share.
gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain of
  three yesterday.
the agreement would be calculated on the basis of
  perelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for a
  split.
for example, a deal between gillette and some other
  company at 44 dlrs per share would make revlon richer by 262
  mln dlrs under the formula.
neither perelman nor his spokesmen
  returned telephone calls seeking comment.
"revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money if
  someone else takes over gillette," said analyst deepak raj of
  merrill lynch and co. "i'm not saying that is going to happen
  but gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45
  dlrs per share."
shore of shearson lehman said there are a couple of reasons
  why perelman may not be really interested in acquiring
  gillette.
he said perelman, in the process of taking revlon
  private after acquiring control of the cosmetics company two
  years ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving revlon's
  operations.
"he's trying to overhaul and improve the image of
  the dearptment store business."
another reason is that revlon
  has recently made two other acquisitions.
under those circumstances, shore would not be surprised if
  some company such as unilever plc &lt;un.as> or procter and gamble
  co &lt;pg> decided to take a look at gillette.
shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers for
  gillette including sir james goldsmith, hanson trust plc &lt;han>,
  rjr nabisco inc &lt;rjr>, american brands inc &lt;amb> and ralston
  purina co &lt;ral>.
"perelman is trying to put the company in play," said a
  wall street arbitrageur.
"he gets to share in the upside if the
  company is sold."
another arbitrageur said he expects gillette
  to resist perelman's overture.
"i can't see the board
  consenting, what has changed between november and now," he
  said.
another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on.
"perelman never does anything without a fair amount of
  calculation," he said.
but he added, "the gillette board has to
  be careful.
they just can't say no or they'll be sued by
  shareholders."
gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 edt,
  three and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time.
according to a copy of perelman's letter released by
  gillette, he would be prepared to sign a defnitive merger
  agreement without any financing condition.
he said citibank
  n.a.
is his lead lender and first boston inc is his financial
  adviser.

force majeure lifted at cajamarquilla
  peru's state minerals marketing arm, minero
  peru comercial sa (minpeco), lifted a force majeure on zinc
  ingot shipments from the country's biggest zinc refinery at
  cajamarquilla, a spokesman said.
the spokesman said the problems affecting sulphuric acid
  and roaster plants that had halted production since may 4 had
  been resolved.
however, he said production of zinc ingots this year was
  expected to fall to around 86,000 tonnes this year at
  cajamarquilla, from 94,000 tonnes in 1986 because of the
  stoppage.
the refinery has an optimum annual production capacity of
  100,000 tonnes but its highest production was 96,000 tonnes of
  refined zinc ingots in 1985, the spokesman said.

senator defends u.s.
mandatory farm control bill
  sen. tom harkin, d-iowa, defended his
  controversial mandatory supply control farm bill and said u.s.
  farmers should be allowed to vote in a referendum whether they
  approve of the proposal.
the harkin proposal would set loan rates of 5.17 dlrs per
  bushel for wheat, 3.77 dlrs for corn and 9.32 dlrs for
  soybeans, all to be put in effect under strict controls on
  planted acreage reductions.
present loan rates are 2.28 dlrs
  for wheat, 1.92 for corn, and effectively 4.56 for soybeans.
also under the plan, the u.s. would seek a world market
  sharing cartel with the european community and other exporting
  nations, to share-out export markets, harkin said during the
  first of several senate agriculture subcommittee hearings
  examining farm programs.
harkin made the following claims in testimony on his
  "family farm act."
-- the mandatory control bill would increase farm income
  and reduce government spending on agriculture.
-- harkin said his policy of high price supports would not
  ruin u.s. agricultural exports as critics claim, but would
  increase overall revenue from exports.
this would be done by seeking agreement among major
  exporting countries including the european community on market
  sharing at agreed high prices.
sen. christopher bond, r-mo., countered during the hearing
  that such a grain export cartel is not workable.
-- harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supports
  would be passed onto consumers, but he said high food prices
  stem more from "gouging" by food processing companies than from
  high farm product prices.
harkin cited what he termed "excessive" net returns on
  equity over five years of 33.4 pct at kellogg, 31.9 pct
  monfort, 22.8 pct nabisco, 22.8 pct conagra, 21.2 pct h.j.
heinz, 19.1 pct ralston purina, 17.2 pct pillsbury and 16.7 pct
  quaker oats.
-- harkin said a "legitimate" concern about his bill would
  be the impact of higher prices on livestock producers.
he said as a transition to the higher prices, he would
  allow livestock producers to purchase commodity credit corp.
  grain stocks for three years.
thereafter, livestock farmers would benefit from a
  "predictable and stable" grain price, he said.
-- harkin said that under his policy approach farm
  participation would be no more "mandatory" than the current
  farm program.
he said farmers now must participate in farm
  programs in order to receive credit for planting and to protect
  farm income.
nova &lt;nvaa.to> considering bid for dome &lt;dmp>
  nova corp is considering a
  takeover bid for dome petroleum ltd, either alone or as part of
  a consortium, nova chairman bob blair said.
"we are thinking about making an offer to dome or amoco
  (canada petroleum co ltd) or the creditors," blair told
  reporters before the annual meeting.
amoco canada is a unit of
  amoco corp &lt;an>, which has made a 5.2 billion-dlr acquisition
  offer for dome.
"there is ongoing, serious thought applied to dome in nova
  and in husky, but no decision of substance as to future action
  has been taken in either company," blair said.
nova owns 43 pct
  of husky oil ltd &lt;hyo.to>.
blair also said that nova has made no decision as to
  whether it would want to be lead partner in a joint purchase of
  dome.
he added that some of the discussions with other parties
  about dome included transcanada pipelines ltd &lt;trp>, but
  refused to name the other participants.
oecd sees german growth hit by low domestic demand
  west german economic growth will slow to
  1.5 pct this year from 2.4 pct in 1986 due to weak domestic
  demand and tougher competition from abroad, the organisation
  for economic cooperation and development (oecd) said in its
  semi-annual review of the world economy.
this view is less favourable than the west german
  government's forecast of a growth rate of under two pct this
  year, but is in line with forecasts by independent economic
  institutes of growth ranging from 1.5 to two pct.
the oecd said that the economy should pick up next year,
  with the gross national product rising by two pct in real
  terms.
the oecd said it assumed the german economy was passing
  through a period of temporary weakness and there would be some
  recovery in business confidence in the near future.
but it warned that the key to an improvement in the economy
  was higher domestic demand, which is only forecast to rise by
  2.5 pct this year and 2.75 pct in 1988, below 1986's 3.7 pct.
while noting that the government is bringing forward a five
  billion mark tax reform to january 1988, the oecd said that "the
  medium to longer-term performance of the west german economy
  could be improved by reduction of subsidies - which would allow
  relatively lower tax rates."
since the oecd report was compiled, the west german federal
  statistics office has released figures showing that the gnp
  actually fell 0.5 pct in real terms in the first quarter of
  this year compared with the final three months of 1986.
diplomatic sources here said that west germany appeared
  likely to finish the year with the lowest growth rate of any of
  the group of seven leading industrial nations.
west germany's current account surplus, the target of
  considerable criticism by the reagan administration, is
  expected to rise slightly to 37 billion dlrs this year from
  35.8 billion in 1986, before declining to 29 billion dlrs in
  1988.
investment firm raises tvx &lt;tvxg.o> stake
  wedge group inc, a houston investment
  firm, said it raised its stake in tvx broadcast group inc to
  682,419 shares, or 15.1 pct of the total outstanding common
  stock, from 559,219 shares, or 12.4 pct.
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission,
  wedge said it bought 123,200 tvx common shares at prices
  ranging from 8.00 to 10.625 dlrs a share.
higher growth, unemployment in france, oecd says
  france's growth rate is expected to
  strengthen in the second half of this year after a poor first
  half, but unemployment will worsen, the organisation for
  economic cooperation and development (oecd) said.
in its semi-annual review of the world economy, the oecd
  forecast that growth in the french gross domestic product (gdp)
  would run at about two pct in the next six months.
it said the
  rate would be in line with the 1986 trends, but significantly
  higher than in the first half of this year.
the oecd said france's economic situation has deteriorated
  somewhat during the early months of 1987.
activity has slowed, primarily reflecting an inventory
  adjustment, while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflation
  has reaccelerated, the oecd said.
unemployment is likely to
  reach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988.
the report said inflation should slow and domestic demand
  pick up in the second half of this year.
but both data are
  likely to be worse than those recorded in 1986, it added.
the oecd forecast a 2.75 pct rise in consumer prices for
  the second half of this year, a one pct drop from the first six
  months.
the slowdown would bring the inflation rate to 3.25 pct
  for the whole year, sharply up from last year's 2.2 pct.
group raises nash finch &lt;nafc.o> stake
  a group including members of the
  sobey family of nova scotia and empire company ltd, said it
  raised its stake in nash finch co to 442,498 shares, or 8.6 pct
  of the total outstanding, from 374,498 shares, or 7.3 pct.
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission,
  the group said it bought 68,000 nash finch common shares
  between april 7 and june 17.
italian economic outlook less bright, oecd says
  italy's economic outlook for 1987 and 1988
  is likely to be less favourable than last year with slightly
  lower growth, higher unemployment and an increased trade
  deficit, the organisation for economic cooperation and
  development (oecd) said.
but the oecd, in its half-yearly report, forecast a
  slightly lower inflation rate over the next two years.
last
  year italy ranked as one of the oecd's fastest growing
  economies with gross domestic product (gdp) growth at 2.7 pct.
the oecd said italy's gdp may grow by three pct in 1987,
  but will then fall back to 2.5 pct in 1988.
the inflation rate will probably stabilise at around five
  pct during the projection period as a result of a turnaround in
  import prices, particularly oil, an acceleration in labour
  costs and the effects of domestic demand pressure, the report
  said.
this year, and to a lesser degree in 1988, domestic demand
  should be stimulated by buoyant growth in household consumption
  made possible by wage increases following pay negotiations.
domestic demand pressure, coupled with the deterioration in
  italian competitiveness, is likely to stimulate imports and
  adversely affect exports in 1987 and 1988.
this could result in
  a sharp negative contribution to the currrent account.
japan trade surplus will grow again in 1987, oecd
  japan's trade surplus is likely to
  continue to grow in 1987, as sales of japanese goods abroad
  increase while domestic demand remains sluggish, the
  organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd)
  said.
in its latest half-yearly review of the world economy, the
  oecd said japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last
  year, when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while
  export markets rose by only two pct.
but it said this differential between the growth of
  domestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988,
  "thus weakening the international adjustment process."
it forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two
  pct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pct
  in 1988.
as a result, the current account surplus in 1987 will
  rise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986, although in
  1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs.
the oecd outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billion
  yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand
  and increase imports to japan.
however, oecd officials said the
  measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quite
  possibly exceeding one pct gnp when the full effects have
  worked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports.
the oecd outlook said, "continued large current account
  surpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantial
  net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure
  on the yen."
it said that further appreciation could then lead
  manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus
  weaken domestic growth.
the oecd said japan's gross national product was likely to
  gorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988, below 1986's 2.5 pct
  growth.
but it said japan would continue its good performance
  on inflation, with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a
  0.6 pct rise in consumer prices last year.
u.s.-canada ties seen worse without trade pact
  u.s.-canadian ties could worsen if
  the two nations are unable to reach a free trade pact,
  according to a study published by two nonpartisan public policy
  research groups.
the cato institute of washington and the fraser institute
  of vancouver said removing the remaining tariffs on cross
  border trade would benefit both countries.
but cato chairman william niskanen added "the two nations'
  generally harmonious trade relations are probably not
  sustainable without a new agreement."
the united states and canada, whose cross-border trade
  totaled about 125 billion dlrs last year, have been holding
  talks since last june on a pact to end the few trade barriers
  remaining between their two countries.
the u.s. put a deadline on the talks of october 1, but both
  sides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargaining
  remained.
niskanen said if no pact is reached, bilateral trade ties
  could deteriorate because of congressional pressure on
  president reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively, and
  this could hit some canadian trade practices.
he noted canada is seeking foreign investment in its auto
  industry, which could put strains on the considerable bilateral
  free trade in u.s. and canadian autos and parts.
niskanen also said the canadian government is vulnerable to
  a resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict u.s.
  exports to canada.
a free trade pact, backed by president reagan and prime
  minister brian mulroney, would open new markets for canada and
  enable its industries to achieve economies of scale, which
  would also help it widen exports worldwide, he said.
it would also increase the gross national products of both
  countries.
niskanen said the goal of a pact should be to end all
  tariffs within 10 years, lower subsidies on exports, set rules
  for trade in services and investments, end curbs on government
  procurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes.
economic growth seen sluggish in benelux countries
  economic growth will remain sluggish in
  the netherlands and belgium next year and unemployment may
  rise, the organisation for economic cooperation and development
  forecast.
belgium's gdp growth may slow down to 1.5 pct this year and
  next year, bringing a rise in the number of jobless, the oecd
  said in its semi-annual survey.
belgian inflation could
  stabilise at 1.5 to 2.0 pct, while the current account surplus
  will probably remain large at about three pct of gdp.
while the belgian government has made progress in trimming
  its borrowing requirement, "it will probably be insufficient to
  check the self-sustaining nature of the deficit," the oecd said.
in the netherlands real gdp growth will also slip to 1.5
  pct this year and one pct in 1988, with dutch exports becoming
  less competitive and imports rising.
"employment is forecast to
  decelerate as well, reflecting more sluggish growth in the
  private sector and budgetary cuts," the report said.
dutch consumer prices are set to fall by 0.5 pct in 1987
  and stay stable in 1988, partly as a result of declining
  domestic gas prices.
luxembourg's economy, by contrast, will see slightly faster
  growth in gdp this year as a result of an upward movement in
  wages.
but real growth in consumption will ease next year.
southern europe has strong domestic demand growth
  strong growth in domestic demand was a key
  feature of the economies of southern european countries in
  1986, though the growth is seen slowing this year and next, the
  organisation for economic cooperation and development said.
in its semi-annual report, the oecd said portugal's total
  domestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year to
  five pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growth
  restrained private consumption.
turkey's economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 and
  domestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expected
  to be halved to five pct next year.
in spain, buoyant domestic demand, led by fixed investment,
  had been the driving force behind rapid growth in gross
  domestic product.
both fixed investment and private consumption
  were expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain
  strong.
the oecd forecast that spanish imports would rise sharply
  next year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the european
  community and declining competitiveness.
in greece, inflation was forecast to turn downwards
  following an increase early this year linked with the
  introduction of value added tax and a surge in food prices due
  to cold weather.
oecd says high wage deals harming nordic states
  high wage settlements in nordic countries
  threaten to cut exports and reduce the international
  competitiveness of their industries, the organisation for
  economic cooperation and development (oecd) said.
in denmark, the oecd said wage settlements concluded in
  early 1987 were likely to contribute to a marked deterioration
  in competitiveness.
sweden's competitive position was also seen
  at risk from accelerating wages.
the oecd predicted that domestic demand would come under
  pressure from tight fiscal policy in denmark, as well as
  norway, sweden and finland.
overall economic growth will vary in the different
  countries between 1986 and 1988, the oecd semi-annual report
  said.
after a strong rise of 7.8 pct in 1986, total domestic
  demand in norway was seen falling by 1.5 pct in 1987 and one
  pct the following year.
denmark was also expected to see a
  slump in domestic demand.
the report said growth in gross
  domestic product (gdp) was likely to speed up slightly in
  sweden and finland in 1987 and 1988, while declining in denmark
  and norway.
iceland needs to try harder to implement its new economic
  strategy if any more progress is to be made towards sustained
  and balanced non-inflationary growth, the oecd said.
oecd urges action to cut u.s. budget deficit
  the united states should take urgent
  action to cut its crippling budget deficit, including possible
  reductions in non-defense spending, higher taxes and curbs on
  growth of the defense budget, the organization for economic
  cooperation and development said.
the oecd, in its semi-annual review of the world economy,
  said a failure of the reagan administration and congress
  quickly to agree on measures to cut the deficit "could seriously
  affect confidence, both in the united states and elsewhere."
it predicted that the federal deficit in fiscal 1987,
  running until september 30 this year, would substantially
  overshoot both the balanced budget act's target of 144 billion
  dlrs and official u.s.
estimates in february of 175 billion.
"the oecd projection, which is based on assumptions of
  slower growth, higher interest rates and actual data for the
  first half of the financial year, is for a deficit of about 190
  billion dollars," it said.
while this would be 30 billion lower than last year's
  deficit, much of the improvement would be due to corporate tax
  increases being introduced before income tax cuts take effect.
the u.s. economic growth rate is expected to edge up to
  2.75 pct next year from 2.5 pct this year and last.
in contrast to the last two years, more competitive exports
  boosted by the fall in the dollar should help gnp growth.
unemployment should continue to fall slowly as the service
  sector continues to create jobs.
but inflation appears to be
  heading higher, partly due to the lower dollar, with consumer
  prices forecast to rise four pct this year and 4.5 pct next
  year after just 2.1 pct in 1986.
"monetary and fiscal policy appear to be the key factors
  behind the avoidance of recession," the report said.
the current account balance of payments deficit is expected
  to be still around a high 125 billion dlrs next year, after
  hitting a projected record 147.25 billion this year, it said.
in canada economic growth is expected to pick up slightly
  to around 2.75 pct in 1988 from 2.5 pct this year, but will
  still be below levels seen in recent years.
inflation is
  expected to slow to 3.5 pct next year from 3.75 pct this year,
  unemployment should edge down to nine pct in 1988 from 9.25 pct
  this year.
canada's current account deficit is projected to shrink to
  around four billion u.s. dlrs this year and to remain at about
  that level in 1988.

joint action said vital to boost world growth
  prospects for world economic growth remain
  very sluggish, and coordinated action by western governments is
  urgently needed to restore business confidence, stabilize
  currencies and encourage investment, the organization for
  economic cooperation and development (oecd) said here.
"the economic situation has deteriorated in recent months,
  and ...
slow growth, high unemployment and large payments
  imbalances are likely to persist," it said in one of its
  gloomiest reviews of the world economy in recent years.
the gross national product (gnp) of the 24-nation bloc of
  western industrialised countries is forecast to grow by only
  2.25 pct both this year and next, even slower than last year's
  2.5 pct growth rate.
"we would like to see the aggregate for the oecd area
  comfortably exceeding three pct," david henderson, head of the
  oecd's economics and statistics department, said.
the oecd said that the dollar fall had led to rising
  inflation expectations and higher interest rates in the u.s.,
  combining with world trade imbalances and the huge third world
  debt problem to increase the risks of a world economic
  downturn.
"at the same time, many of the conditions for faster growth
  remain favorable," it said, citing low inflation in most major
  countries, healthy corporate finances, generally lower interest
  rates, improvements in state budget positions and more flexible
  labor markets.
but private sector confidence had been undermined by
  uncertainties over exchange rates, it said, and warned that "for
  confidence to be restored, it is important for governments
  swiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments."
this was a clear reference to last february's louvre accord
  of the group of five nations plus canada, analysts said.
the oecd said that apparent disagreements among major
  countries on implementation of the louvre accord had helped to
  undermine business confidence, and called on more active fiscal
  policies from the u.s., west germany and japan to slow demand
  in the u.s. and raise it in the other two countries.
henderson said the 6,000 billion yen package announced
  recently by the japanese government to encourage public works
  and cut taxes would make a significant contribution to this
  process, though it was too early to estimate its precise
  impact.
he said the measures will help strengthen japan's domestic
  demand significantly, quite possibly exceeding one pct of gnp.
the inflation outlook, while broadly satisfactory, has
  worsened in recent months, with oecd consumer prices forecast
  to rise 3.5 pct this year and 3.75 pct in 1988 after a 2.8 pct
  increase in 1986.
there is no prospect for any significant improvement in the
  unemployment situation over the next 18 months, with the
  average rate expected to stabilize at 8.25 pct, similar to last
  year.
the oecd called for efforts to liberalize world
  agricultural markets through switching farm subsidies away from
  price guarantees and other measures linked to production
  towards direct income support for farmers.

australia set to grow, but unemployment may rise
  australia's economy should manage modest
  growth over the next two years after a sharp slowdown but
  unemployment could still edge upwards, the organisation for
  economic cooperation and development (oecd) said.
the organisation's latest half-yearly report says gross
  domestic product will grow by 2.5 pct this year and by 2.75 pct
  in 1988 compared with only 1.4 pct in 1986.
the growth will be
  helped by higher stockbuilding and stronger domestic demand
  following tax cuts and higher real wages, it added.
the report forecasts a decline in inflation, with consumer
  prices increasing by 8.5 pct this year and 6.25 pct in 1988.
the current account deficit shows signs of easing slightly
  and could narrow to 12 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.
while predicting slightly stronger growth than last year,
  however, the report revises downwards the oecd's earlier growth
  forecast for 1987 of 3.75 pct.
the oecd predicts a similar combination of modest economic
  growth and rising unemployment for new zealand, which is
  struggling to recover from a major economic crisis.
the country's gdp, which contracted by 0.6 pct last year,
  should again show growth over the next two years, rising by
  0.25 pct this year and a more substantial 2.75 pct in 1988.
squibb &lt;sqb> said not interested in buying cetus
  robert fildes, president and chief
  executive of cetus corp &lt;ctus.o>, told reuters that squibb corp
  is not interested in buying cetus.
earlier the companies said squibb would buy from cetus a
  five pct equity postion in cetus for about 40 mln dlrs.
"this is not an attempt by squibb to become a major
  majority holder in cetus," fildes told reuters in an interview.
"squibb has not approached us with any indication that they
  want to acquire us and we wouldn't be interested in that kind
  of arrangement," said fildes.
squibb could not be reached to comment on the late comments
  by fildes.
squibb is cetus' first pharmaceutical partner and the only
  one to own an equity position in cetus.
eastman kodak co &lt;ek>
  and w.r. grace &lt;wr> both have joint ventures with cetus, but
  neither owns an equity position in the company, said fildes.
cetus has a venture with kodak to develp diagnostic
  products and with grace to develop agricultural products.
earlier, squibb and cetus announced in a joint statement 
  an agreement in principle to form a joint venture to develop
  new biotechnology products in several fields.
as part of the deal squibb will license several of cetus'
  anticancer agents, including interleukin-2, in development.
squibb will sell the drugs only in japan and other markets but
  not in north american and western europe.
"we wouldn't have done this deal had it not been understood
  that cetus wants to build its own fully integrated business in
  north america and europe," said fildes.
he said squibb was the good partner because squibb has a
  major joint venture in japan and has sales capabilities of its
  own in that market.
fildes said cetus has shunned licensing arrangements with
  pharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its own
  business.
many large corporations have invested in small
  biotech firms.
but squibb's investment in cetus is the first it has made
  in biotechnology.
fildes said that was attractive to cetus
  because it wanted a partner that didn't have a relationship
  with a large number of other biotechnology companies."
fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drug
  areas like diagnostics and agriculture, but to "keep the
  biggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves."
fildes said the partnership with squibb would be used to
  broaden the company's reach in such big money making areas
  as the cardiovascular, anti-infective and the anti-inflammatory
  markets.
squibb is also investming 75 mln dlrs in cetus' research
  over the next five years.
"squibb is putting up over 75 mln dlrs in research and
  development to make it happen, while the equity position part
  of the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of this
  partnership," said fildes.

fall in canadian budget deficit to slow
  finance minister michael wilson said tax
  reform will not affect his determination to reign in
  expenditures, but his forecasts show a slowing of the decline
  in the budget deficit in the late 1980s.
"responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible,"
  wilson said in a speech prepared for the house of commons.
wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrs
  in the year ending march 31, 1988, the same level as he
  forecast in the february budget.
and in the year ended this past march, the deficit was
  expected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32
  billion dlr shortfall originally forecast, wilson said.
wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal year
  higher-than-anticipated spending, particularly in farm income
  support programs, will be offset by higher-than-anticipated
  revenues.
but finance department documents show the pace of deficit
  reduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and
  1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and the
  transition to the reformed taxation system.
the deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs in
  fiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1
  billion dlrs in 1991.
wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the canadian
  economy, forcasting gross domestic product would expand 2.8 pct
  this year and 3.0 pct in 1988.
in 1986 the economy grew by an
  actual 3.1 pct.
inflation, meanwhile, is expected to stabilize at around
  the current four pct level over the next two years.

fed data suggest no change in monetary policy
  new u.s. banking data suggest the
  federal reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady path
  and is not signalling any imminent change of course, economists
  said.
but they also said that if money supply growth remains
  weak, as this week's unexpected eight billion dlr m-1 decline
  suggests it may, this could influence the fed to loosen its
  credit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetary
  policy.
a reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced a
  forecast of a 600 mln dlr m-1 decline for the week ended june
  8, with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to a
  decline of four billion.
instead, m-1 fell eight billion dlrs
  to 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.
coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in m-1 for
  the week ended june 1, this means the nation's money supply has
  fallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks,
  economists said.
"m-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness," said bill sullivan
  of dean witter reynolds inc.
while m-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of
  economic growth, sullivan said fed officials might be concerned
  the latest drop in m-1 means another month of sluggish growth
  in the broader monetary aggregates, m-2 and m-3, which are seen
  as better gauges of economic growth.
latest monthly m-2 and m-3 data showed that as of may, both
  measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the fed's
  5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.
if money growth does not accelerate, fed officials,
  concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging,
  could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.
"does this mean that the fed abandons its current open
  market position?
no," sullivan said.
"but does this mean the end
  of tightening for the time being?
definitely yes."
economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings
  of 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period
  were lower than they had expected.
most believed the fed had
  targetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs.
but they said that if it had not been for a large one-day
  net miss in the fed's reserve projections, the higher
  borrowings target would probably have been reached.
a drop in may u.s. housing starts and continued weakness in
  auto sales show key sectors of the u.s. economy are lagging,
  while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in may producer prices has
  helped dispel inflation fears, slifer said.
"if this continues, we can entertain the notion of fed
  easing at some point," he said.
other economists said the fed would probably pay little
  attention to weak money supply growth.
"it has been a number of
  years since m-1 has given good signs of what's going on in the
  economy," one said.
"i don't think m-1 shows that the economy is
  falling apart and the fed should ease."
economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a
  prerequisite for any move by the fed toward easier monetary
  policy.
they said the fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates
  for fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and
  higher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke
  off econmomic growth.
but sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late
  april.
"the fed has to determine if this represents a
  fundamental change for the dollar.
if it does, then this gives
  them more room to ease," he said.

shultz warns asean of looming trade problem
  u.s. secretary of state george shultz
  warned members of the association of southeast asian nations
  (asean) they could no longer rely on increased exports to the
  u.s. for growth.
"given the importance of exports, particularly export
  manufactures, to all of your countries, you are going to have
  to work hard to diversify your markets," he said.
"while you may be able to maintain your current market share
  in the u.s., you clearly will not be able to look to the u.s.
  to take major increases in your exports," he added.
shultz told the foreign ministers of brunei, indonesia,
  malaysia, the philippines, singapore and thailand the u.s.
  would cut its huge foreign trade deficit more rapidly than many
  now believed.
he said asean's looming trade problems would not
  necessarily stem from protectionist legislation now being
  contemplated by congress, "but simply because of the adjustments
  the u.s. economy will have to make in order to service our
  large and growing external debt."
shultz said the u.s. deficit had resulted not from falling
  exports but from higher imports that had fuelled world growth.
indonesia raises stake in aluminium plant
  indonesia has increased its share in a
  434-billion-yen aluminium smelter joint venture with japan from
  25 to 37 pct, asahan project authority director a.r.
suhud
  said.
the japanese export-import bank said indonesia had raised
  its share of (p.t.
indonesia asahan aluminium) company,
  capitalised in 1975 at 91 billion, by swapping 32 billion yen
  in government loans to the company for an equity stake.
the japanese shareholders, the overseas economic
  cooperation fund and 12 companies, are to invest another 24
  billion yen raising capitalisation to 147 billion yen.
asahan reported total losses of 97.6 billion rupiah between
  1982 and 1985.
suhud said much of the company's 320 billion yen
  debt had been caused by falling tin prices and the appreciation
  of the yen against the u.s. dollar.
aluminium is sold in
  dollars.
prices improved from 1,150 dlrs a tonne six months ago to
  about 1,450 dlrs today.
the plant is supposed to break even if
  prices stay at 1,500 dlrs a tonne.
sahud said the plant, with a capacity of 220,000 tonnes a
  year, would probably lose money again in 1987.
the plant,
  situated in north sumatra, produces mostly for japan.
taiwan dollar and reserves seen rising more slowly
  recent government moves to curb capital
  inflow have temporarily helped to slow the rise of taiwan's
  foreign exchange reserves and to stabilise the local dollar
  against the u.s. currency, officials and bankers said.
central bank governor chang chi-cheng told reporters the
  reserves rose only about 500 mln u.s. dlrs in the past two
  weeks and the local dollar appreciated more slowly against the
  u.s. dollar.
chang said, "the pace of increase in our reserves is much
  slower now than before and our currency is getting more stable."
he said the reserves, mainly the result of the trade surplus
  with the u.s., rose at the rate of two to three billion u.s.
  dlrs a month between january and may.
the reserves, the world's third largest after japan and
  west germany, now total well over 60 billion u.s. dlrs.
on june 2 the central bank froze overseas borrowings of
  local and foreign banks and cut the limit on central bank
  purchases of forward u.s.
dollars from banks to 40 pct from 90
  pct of the value of a contract.
local and foreign bankers said the june 2 measures had
  drastically limited their ability to lend foreign exchange to
  importers and exporters.
they said their overseas borrowings and forward dollar
  transactions showed a drastic decline with some banks
  registering a fall of up to 30 pct.
bank dealers said the taiwan dollar has stabilised against
  the u.s. currency this week after rising two to five taiwanese
  cents a day between june 2 and 13 compared with a rise of five
  to eight cents in may.
the bank dealers said the central bank, which had
  previously bought u.s.
dollars heavily, sold at least 1.1
  billion u.s. dlrs in the past two weeks to meet commercial
  demand.
they said they expected the government to keep the local
  dollar stable in the near term to give breathing space to
  businesses experiencing slower exports because of the rise of
  more than 23 pct in the value of the taiwan dollar since
  september 1985.
the taiwan dollar opened at 31.09 to the u.s. dollar today,
  unchanged from yesterday.
keh fei-lo, vice president of first commercial bank, said,
  "it appears the central bank's move to curb the capital inflow
  is quite successful."
vice economic minister wang chien-shien said the slower
  rise in foreign exchange reserves would help ease pressure from
  washington over the large u.s. trade deficit with taiwan.
over the past year taiwanese businessmen have delayed
  imports of machinery and production equipment because of
  exchange rate uncertainty, he said.
the stable exchange rate
  would help boost imports, particularly from the united states.
japan approves aid for indonesia, brazil aluminium
  japan's cabinet approved a plan to help
  financially-troubled aluminium ventures in indonesia and
  brazil, an official at the ministry of international and trade
  industry (miti) said.
japan will invest 24 billion yen in &lt;pt indonesia asahan
  aluminium> in addition to the 68.3 billion yen already invested
  in the company.
the government and private interests will
  equally share the additional investment, he said.
they will also provide equal shares in 6.3 billion yen in
  new investment in the albras amazon aluminium project in
  brazil, in addition to the 45.7 billion yen already invested.
the japan export-import bank will cut its rates on loans to
  asahan and albras to about five pct from about seven pct, the
  official said.
interest rates on loans by japan's private banks to the two
  projects are expected to be reduced to around five pct from the
  current seven to eight pct, but an agreement has yet to be
  reached, industry sources said.
under the rescue scheme for asahan, in which 91.1 billion
  yen has been invested, indonesia will also extend another 32
  billion yen to the company.
this will raise indonesia's
  investment ratio to about 40 pct from the current 25 pct.
the brazilian government has already agreed to invest an
  additional 6.5 billion yen in albras, in which investment now
  totals 93.2 billion yen, but its stake will not change from 51
  pct, the official said.
the sources said the rescue programs for the two projects
  were larger than earlier expected, reflecting japan's desire to
  help develop the economies of indonesia and brazil and to
  stabilise sources of aluminium.
japan depends on imports for more than 90 pct of its
  aluminium demand, which totals some 1.8 mln tonnes a year, they
  said.

the shaw's board and the davis family has agreed to accept
  the offer, thus assuring sainsbury's a total holding of 74.0
  pct.
the company had allotted 20.18 mln new ordinary shares to
  &lt;warburg securities ltd> which it said would be sufficient to
  finance about 188 mln dlrs of the maximum 261 mln dlrs payable.
shaw's operates a chain of 49 supermarkets in

  sales of 1.1 billiob dlrs and pretax profit of 31.1 mln.
at the
  end of 1986 it had net assets of 88 mln dlrs.

bangladesh navy unloads grains during port strike
  the navy is unloading
  foodgrains at chittagong port following a strike by nearly
  1,000 dockworkers, bangladesh shipping corp officials said.
the navy was unloading 74,000 tonnes of foodgrains from two
  ships today, and four vessels laden with some 90,000 tonnes of
  grains were waiting at the outer anchorage, port officials
  said.
a spokesman for the workers said they would continue their
  strike until authorities agree to their demands for higher pay
  and other benefits.
the strike began on june 11.
"unloading of grains and other essential commodities started
  normally after we called in navy personnel to help," a port
  official told reuters.
"the strike has caused no serious dislocation," he said.
the government meanwhile declared the port jobs an
  "essential service" and said the strikers could be dismissed
  unless they end the strike soon.
taiwan buys 32,000 tonnes of u.s. soybeans
  the joint committee of taiwan's soybean

  soybeans, a committee spokesman told reuters.
the cargo, priced at 249.10 u.s. dlrs per tonne c and f
  taiwan, is set for delivery before july 7, he said.
the committee cancelled a tender for another cargo because
  the prices offered by u.s.
suppliers were too high, he added.
agency head says japan should cut rice price
  the government should cut its consumer
  rice price if the official producer price is reduced next
  month, tetsuo kondo, director general of the government's
  economic planning agency (epa), told reporters.
kondo said after a cabinet meeting that consumers should
  receive the benefits of the falling costs of rice farming due
  to the strong yen and lower oil prices.
agriculture ministry sources said the producer rice price
  paid to rice farmers would be cut after discussions by the rice
  price council, an advisory body to the ministry, on july 1 and
  2.
the consumer rice price is usually set in december.
japan panel urges world economic adjustments
  japan could avoid a sharp rise in the
  value of the yen against the dollar if japan, the u.s. and
  other nations succeeded in restructuring their economies, an
  advisory panel to the government's economic planning agency
  (epa) said.
the advisory body said in its report that the yen would
  soar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a global
  basis were delayed.
an epa official told reuters the dollar could fall to
  slightly below 100 yen by 1993 if japan and the u.s. failed to
  restructure their economies.
the dollar's fall without structural adjustments would cut
  japan's current account surplus to two pct of gross national
  product (gnp) in 1993, the report said.
it said such a change
  would slow real gnp growth to an average of two pct annually
  during the seven-year period to 1993.
if the two nations restructured their economies, the dollar
  would remain stable in real terms, while reducing japan's
  current-account surplus to 2.1 pct of gnp in 1993.
this
  scenario put japan's gnp growth at 3.5 pct a year.
it forecast real growth of three pct for the world economy
  and four pct for japan by 2,000 if the adjustments were made.
japan must try harder to cut surplus - minister
  japan must try harder to reduce its trade
  surplus or the yen will come under renewed upward pressure,
  economic planning minister tetsuo kondo.
he told a press luncheon he hoped japan could cut its
  current account surplus by some 10 billion dlrs a year until it
  is reduced to some 50 to 60 billion dlrs.
in the fiscal year
  ended march 31 the surplus totalled 93.76 billion dlrs, or
  about 4.5 pct of gnp.
the 6,000 billion yen economic stimulation package the
  government unveiled late last month would help slash japan's
  current account surplus by five to six billion dlrs, he said.
thai smelter faces tin concentrate supply shortage
  thailand's major tin exporter and
  producer &lt;thailand smelting and refining co> (thaisarco) said
  it may be unable to meet all its overseas orders because of
  insufficient supplies of tin concentrates from thai mines.
local mines cut combined daily tin concentrate sales to
  thaisarco, a royal dutch/shell group &lt;rd.as> unit, to less than
  20 tonnes earlier this month from a previous 40 to 45 tonne
  average, commercial manager yoot eamsa-ard told reuters.
he said the cuts resulted from a government decision to let
  the temporary business and municipal tax reductions on exported
  tin lapse on june 3.
the taxes, levied on the tin mines, rose to 4.4 pct this
  month from 1.1 pct ad valorem over the past year.
the lower
  levels had been introduced last year as a temporary move to aid
  the tin industry after prices collapsed in late 1985.
yoot said thaisarco had to dig into its stocks to meet a
  large portion of new overseas orders which were averaging 100
  tonnes per day.
as a result, he said, thailand could fail to fill some
  3,000 tonnes of its 19,000 tonne tin export quota allocated by
  the association of tin producing countries (atpc) for the year
  ending february 1988.
reduced tin exports this year could cause the atpc to
  allocate a lower quota next year, yoot said.
the supplies shortage should prove temporary, however,
  because the thai cabinet is expected to review a mineral
  resources department proposal to reinstate the low taxes late
  this month, yoot said.
the department said thailand exported 7,715 tonnes of tin
  during january/may compared with 8,462 tonnes a year ago.
sri lanka plans to renew abu dhabi oil contract
  ceylon petroleum corp (cpc) has decided
  to renew its one-year contract with abu dhabi for 480,000
  tonnes of upper zakum crude oil, cpc officials told reuters.
they said cpc made the recommendation to the cabinet and is
  now awaiting its approval.
cpc's one-year contract with abu dhabi expired on may 31
  this year and it wants the renewed contract to begin on june 1
  at the government selling price.
delivery will be determined in
  the course of the year.
last year, shipments were in three
  parcels of 120,000 tonnes each and four of 30,000 tonnes each.
cpc officials also said the company agreed with the
  egyptian government for the supply of 240,000 tonnes of gulf of
  suez crude for delivery in two shipments this year at the
  government selling price.
last year, cpc bought 120,000 tonnes gulf of suez through
  c.itoh.
officials said plans to buy 240,000 tonnes of basra light
  from iraq have not been finalised yet because of several
  constraints.
cpc said it could not accept 120,000 tonne parcels
  and proposed to lift 30,000 tonnes in eight shipments.
iraq national oil co (inoc) told cpc a red sea port where
  lifting was to take place could not accept small ships.
inoc
  then proposed to deliver eight shipments of 30,000 tonnes each.
cpc said inoc planned to ship the oil to an indian port for
  delivery of indian requirements, later going to colombo to
  offload cpc's needs, but cpc considered this unsuitable.
cpc said it had not received a reply from inoc since
  december.
sri lanka imports all its annual needs of 1.7 mln
  tonnes.
this year it plans to buy 400,000 tonnes on the spot
  market compared with about 1.3 mln tonnes last year.
taiwan's evergreen line to go public
  liner shipping specialist &lt;evergreen
  marine corp>, taiwan's largest private company, has applied to
  the security and exchange commission to go public next month, a
  company spokeswoman told reuters.
she said evergreen had doubled its capital to eight billion
  taiwan dlrs since last august.
"the capital increase will boost our operations," she said.
she said evergreen will use the funds raised from the stock
  market to buy new ships and step up its global services.
the spokeswoman said the company posted an after-tax profit
  of more than one billion dlrs last year on total revenues of
  20.46 billion, compared to an after-tax profit of 1.18 billion
  on revenues of 17.99 billion in 1985.
evergreen has placed newbuilding orders for three 3,428-teu
  (twenty-foot equivalent unit) fully cellular container ships
  with the state-owned &lt;china shipbuilding corp> for delivery in
  late 1988.
evergreen has a fleet of 66 container vessels, totalling
  more than two mln dwt, the spokeswoman said.
s. african reserve bank says growth rate on target
  south africa recorded annualised
  real growth in gdp of 3.25 pct in the first quarter of this
  year and the economy should achieve the government's target of
  three pct growth for 1987, the reserve bank said.
the south african central bank said in its quarterly
  bulletin that confidence in the economy improved from january
  to may 31 because of the higher gold price, a rise in the
  nation's gold and foreign currency reserves and an improvement
  in the rand's exchange rate to just under 50 u.s.
cents.
it noted the growth rate had slowed from 4.5 pct in the
  third and fourth quarters of last year.
it also cited a three year debt recheduling agreement
  reached with international creditors in march as evidence of
  improved foreign perceptions of the south african economy.
the accord effectively extends a moratorium on most
  repayments of 13 billion dlrs of south africa's short term
  foreign debt.
total foreign debt is 23 billion dlrs.
south africa recorded a seasonally adjusted annualised
  surplus on the current account of the balance of payments of
  7.43 billion rand in the first quarter, compared with a surplus
  of 7.24 billion rand in 1986.
the bank said it was the ninth
  consecutive current account surplus since the start of 1985.
dutch industrial production falls 6.4 pct in april
  dutch seasonally adjusted industrial
  production fell by 6.4 pct in april compared with the previous
  month, and was 5.5 pct down on the same period last year,
  figures from the official statistics bureau cbs show.
the april index, base 1980, stood at 103.
in march,
  industrial production rose by 2.8 pct from february.
the unadjusted april index figure fell 14 pct from march to
  104, compared with a 10 pct rise in march over february.

canada consumer price index up 0.6 pct in may
  canada's consumer price index rose 0.6
  pct in may to 137.8, base 1981, following a 0.4 pct rise in
  april and a 0.5 pct rise in may 1986, statistics canada said.
the may year-on-year rise was 4.6 pct, compared with a 4.5
  pct rise in april.
german producer prices rise 0.1 pct in may
  west german producer prices rose 0.1
  pct in may compared with april to stand 2.9 pct lower than in
  may last year, the federal statistics office said.
in april, producer prices fell 0.3 pct from march and
  dropped 3.6 pct from their levels a year earlier.
the statistics office said producer prices for liquefied
  gas fell 10 pct in may from april and heavy heating oil prices
  declined 5.3 pct, while lead prices rose 23 pct and silver
  prices increased 13 pct.
japan firms to launch sales of 100 octane gasoline
  japanese oil companies are starting
  campaigns to market 100 octane gasoline to meet growing
  domestic demand for higher quality motor fuel, oil sources
  said.
ten companies plan to offer the unleaded gasoline this
  summer, starting with &lt;idemitsu kosan co ltd> on june 20.
showa shell sekiyu kk &lt;shol.t> introduced its formula shell
  98 octane gasoline to the japanese market in january this year.
formula shell has achieved strong sales in japan despite a
  higher price than regular octane gasoline, which has prompted
  other oil firms to offer a rival product, the sources said.
"we have received a good response from consumers of formula
  shell in terms of a smoother ride and effective fuel
  consumption," showa shell said.
shell's product sells for 145 yen per litre, 15 yen higher
  than regular gasoline, and has already achieved a 38 pct share
  of japan's high octane gasoline market, it said.
high octane gasoline accounts for 25 pct of shell's total
  gasoline sales in japan, it added.
idemitsu said it hopes to raise high octane sales to 20 pct
  of its total gasoline sales from about seven pct, immediately
  after the launch of its idemitsu 100.
nippon oil co ltd &lt;npol.t> said it will launch its 100
  octane gasoline on july 1, aiming for an increase in high
  octane sales to 20 pct from six pct of its total gasoline
  sales.
the rush to compete for high octane gasoline market share
  has been spurred by expectations that the government will lift
  gasoline production quotas and restrictions on gasoline station
  construction in the next two to three years.
"major oil companies are trying to boost their gasoline
  sales network ahead of the proposed lifting of gasoline
  production quotas," an official at a major oil company said.
an advisory panel to the ministry of international trade
  and industry (miti) recommended this week that the government
  press ahead with deregulation of the oil industry, including
  the lifting of gasoline production quotas, to help oil
  companies increase their international competitiveness.
japan's three biggest gasoline marketers, nippon oil,
  idemitsu and showa shell, suffered supply shortages under the
  production quota guideline in fiscal 1986, ended last march.
domestic gasoline demand during the year was up 2.5 pct
  from the previous year, according to a miti report.
bpcc planning sale of packaging operations
  the british printing and communication
  corp plc&lt;bpl.l> is considering selling its specialist packaging
  and labelling operations, a spokeswoman said.
she gave no dates or prices for the transaction but said
  the units would be sold by negotiation.
she declined to give any turnover or profit figures for the
  packaging and labelling operations, beyond saying that they
  were very profitable.
they formed a self-contained part of the
  overall group, she said.
analysts said the packaging and labelling division could be
  sold for up to 150 mln stg.
earlier this week group chairman robert maxwell also said
  it expected to float its mirror group newspaper subsidiary,
  bought from  reed international plc &lt;reed.l> for 100 mln stg in
  1984.
the spokeswoman said that bpcc intended to keep a majority
  share in the newspaper group if it was floated.
bpcc is currently locked in legal battles resulting from
  its attempt to take over u.s.
publisher harcourt brace
  jovanovich inc &lt;hbj>.
earlier this week, bpcc launched a
  two-for-three rights issue to raise 640 mln stg and said the
  money raised would enable it to renew its assault on harcourt.
it has also expressed interest in dutch publisher kluwer nv
  &lt;kluw.as>.

belgian one-day strike hits transport, shipping
  a 24-hour strike by belgian public
  employees protesting against a government pay offer disrupted
  transport and hit ferry services and shipping, port and union
  officials said.
some cross-channel ferry services from ostend were
  cancelled, the local news agency belga said.
an antwerp port authority spokesman said electricians came
  out in support, reducing ship movements to a trickle.
unions
  said ghent and other major belgian ports were also hit.
few trains were running and some early morning flights by
  sabena, belgian's national airline, were cancelled.
china resumes ussr ship repairs after 23 year gap
  china has resumed repairs of soviet ships
  after a 23 year break caused by the ideological split between
  the two countries.
the new china news agency said an agreement to resume the
  business was signed by the two sides on wednesday in shanghai,
  where three soviet commercial vessels were being repaired.
the china daily said the first two soviet ships to be
  repaired in china since 1964 left the ports of dalian and
  xingang last month.
bi yueran, managing director of china state shipbuilding
  corp's ship repair department, told the newspaper the soviet
  union lacked adequate repair facilities for the more than 600
  ships deployed in the far east.
bi said china's yards offered
  competitive prices, guaranteed quality and prompt delivery.
tracomin sees lower u.s.
edible groundnut exports
  u.s. exports of edible
  groundnuts could fall to 185,000 tonnes in the year to
  september 1987 from 248,000 in the same 1986 period, trading
  company tracomin sa said.
it revised its december 1986 forecast that exports would
  total 205,000 tonnes, citing low demand, the loss of u.s.
  market share in the two main importing countries, britain and
  the netherlands, and the sale of nuts intended for export at a
  premium in the u.s.
domestic market.
tracomin estimated export availability from the 1986 crop
  at 215,000 tonnes compared with 264,000 the previous year.
tracomin said it expects a good 1987 u.s. groundnut crop
  and forecast a resurgence in u.s. exports next year.
"barring any market manipulations, a good u.s.
harvest in
  1987 could lead to attractive prices, active trading and the
  reappearance of the u.s.a as the world's leading producer of
  peanuts," it said.
overall exports from china, the leading exporter last year,
  will remain at exceptionally high levels this year despite
  quality complaints and difficulties in implementing some
  earlier high-priced contracts.
it is too early to say if china
  can retain its current market share in 1988, tracomin said.
saudi oil reserves rise despite higher output
  proven oil and gas deposits in saudi
  arabia increased in 1986 despite higher oil output, according
  to the kingdom's main producing company, aramco.
recoverable oil reserves in aramco fields rose to 167
  billion barrels by the end the year from 166.5 billion in 1985,
  while gas reserves jumped by 7.7 pct to 135.8 trillion cu ft
  from 126.1 trillion, the company's annual report said.
aramco, responsible for all saudi production except about
  200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the neutral zone between saudi
  arabia and kuwait, increased production to 4.69 mln barrels per
  day in 1986 from 3.04 mln barrels a year earlier.
most of 1986 was a virtual free-for-all in production, as
  opec members abandoned restraint in an effort to recapture
  their share of the market.
in the process, prices collapsed
  from about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs, until the
  organisation decided to cut production again from last
  september onwards.
saudi output in 1985 had been the lowest since the 1960s.
production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightly
  to 304,178 bpd from 316,310, said the report, carried on the
  official saudi press agency.
the increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in the
  number of wells aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985.
aramco's only refinery, at ras tannurah, processed 142.44
  mln barrels (390,246 bpd) of crude last year.
the plant was
  upgraded to a capacity of 530,000 bpd during the year, enabling
  it to supply 50 pct of local demand for oil products, the
  report said.
the country's other five, smaller refineries -- owned by
  another state-owned oil organisation, petromin -- produced
  around 750,000 bpd last year.
sulphur production rose to 1.23 mln tonnes in 1986 from
  998,707 tonnes in 1985.
during the year the company began
  operating a sulphur granule plant with capacity of 4,000 tonnes
  per day, the report said.
aramco said it awarded 1,303 contracts last year worth 1.4
  billion riyals -- about 370 mln dlrs.

spain cargo firms hire dockers to offset strike
  cargo handling companies said they

chrysler &lt;c> to tender for electrospace &lt;ele>
  chrysler corp said electrospace systems
  inc agreed to be acquired under a merger agreement in which
  chrysler will tender 27 dlrs a share for 100 pct of the
  richardson, texas-based defense electronics contractor.
it said total cost to chrysler to buy all of the
  outstanding stock would be about 367 mln dlrs.
electrospace systems designs, develops and installs
  communications and electronic  systems and equipment for the
  specialized needs of military and commercial customers
  worldwide.
chrysler said electrospace will help its gulfstream
  operations grow in military and commercial aircraft sales.
but it said there are no plans to merge gulfstream and
  electrospace.
rather, they will operate as "sister companies,"
  it said.
chrysler said its tender offer is expected to begin by june
  25 and will be managed by first boston corp.
      for the fiscal year ended april 3, 1987, electrospace
  systems had earnings of 10 mln dlrs on sales of 191 mln dlrs.
the company employs 2,500 people.
about 92 pct of its sales
  were to the military.
opec president lukman expects short, calm meeting
  opec conference president rilwanu lukman
  said he expects next week's ministerial meeting in vienna to be
  brief and calm and that opec's current price and production
  agreement may only need a slight review.
"i expect the meeting in vienna to be short and calm,"
  lukman, who is also nigerian oil minister, told reporters here
  ahead of his departure on sunday for the conference, which
  starts june 25.
"we already have an agreement which may need only a slight
  review," lukman said.
the agreement reached at a long session of opec ministers
  in december last year pegged the group's crude oil output at
  15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 at fixed prices of around 18
  dlrs a barrel.
since then prices have risen from 15 dlrs in december to
  just above the official opec levels, with oil industry analysts
  firmly convinced the organisation will maintain the agreement
  to keep the market stable.
"i myself believe that opec will tend to take a position to
  strengthen the gains we have made so far," lukman said.
he declined to say if the current ceiling should be
  maintained or raised to 16.6 mln bpd for the third quarter and
  18.3 mln for the fourth as provisionally agreed last december.
"whatever decision we arrive at will be guided by our
  collective will to keep the market strong," he said.
he said non-opec member norway, which he visited two weeks
  ago, had pledged further cooperation with the group and this
  was significant for its members.
lukman said heavy destocking by consumers early this year
  when opec's fixed price regime came into effect and a
  restocking now for the winter was responsible for current
  market strength.
davis mining revises offer for becor &lt;bcw>
  becor western inc said
  &lt;davis mining and manufacturing inc> has amended its offer for

nat'l computer &lt;nlcs.o> to buy data card stake
  national computer systems inc
  said it agreed to acquire deluxe check printers inc's &lt;dlx> 38
  pct stake in data card corp.
      national computer said it plans to issue 45 mln dlrs in

separately, deluxe said its data card investment no longer
  fits its business strategy.
deluxe has held an interest in data

reagan says trade bill faces veto in present form
  president reagan said he would veto a

  "unfair trade" if it reached its desk in its present form.
in a statement at a white house meeting with senate
  republicans on the legislation, he said: "i would have no choice
  but to veto that bill in its present form."
he said the measure "would move us exactly in the wrong
  direction" towards high tariffs, trade barriers, trade
  distorting subsidies, slow growth and crimped world markets,
  and would destroy jobs.
ghana lifts rice/maize import ban due to drought
  ghana has lifted a ban on rice and maize
  imports due to crop problems caused by unusually dry weather,
  the official ghana news agency (gna) reported today.
secretary for finance and economic planning kwesi botchwey
  made the announcement last night while accepting 7,891 tonnes
  of rice worth about four mln dlrs under a japanese food aid
  programme.
the lifting of the ban, imposed earlier this year, follows
  government concern over "lower than average rainfall in southern
  ghana and its implications for the major harvest."
botchwey said rain has been lacking in major cereal growing
  areas throughout the south this year.
the ministry of
  agriculture has predicted a fall of at least 25 pct in all
  major staple crops including maize, rice and cassava.
gna quoted botchwey as saying that while the consequences
  of current reduced rainfall will be nowhere near the drought
  experiences of 1982/83 the government has taken steps to
  alleviate anticipated food production shortfalls.
the failure of seasonal rains has already seriously
  affected drinking water supplies, farming and fishing in parts
  of the central and volta regions of ghana where rivers have
  dried up.
u.k. central bank warns of excessive rate cuts
  bank of england governor robin
  leigh-pemberton said lowering interest rates too fast could
  jeopardise recent economic achievements in the u.k.
in remarks prepared for delivery to businessmen in
  birmingham, he said prospective returns on real investment are
  more favourable, relative to those on financial assets, than
  for a good number of years.
"it would surely be foolish to put that favourable
  conjuncture at risk by lowering interest rates prematurely or
  excessively," he said.
"we might enjoy a short-term boost to activity, but at the
  risk of a damaging return to the uncertainty and acrimony of
  high inflation," he added.
leigh-pemberton said he recognised there are some who would
  argue that interest rates are still too high and deter
  investment in industry.
"but we should not forget that less than a year ago we were
  intervening to support sterling and had some temporary
  difficulty in persuading the markets that a one pct increase in
  base rates, to 11 pct, was a sufficient tightening of policy at
  the time," he added.
base rate is currently nine pct.
failure of ec farm price talks disrupts tenders
  there will be no serious bids at european
  community open market tenders for wheat and barley until ec
  farm ministers agree to the 1987/88 farm price package, trade
  sources said.
the failure of farm ministers this week to come to an
  agreement resulted in no bids at this week's tender for export
  subsidies and traders said bids are unlikely as long as the
  uncertainty remains.
one trader said permanent damage to export prospects can be
  avoided if an agreemend can be reached soon, but the situation
  will become more serious as time passes.
however, traders said there seem to be few buyers around,
  lessening the disruptive impact of the delay.
poland and south korea, who are in the market for feed
  wheat, will be offered intervention grain through special
  tenders, traders said.

u.k.
lenders offer more fixed rate mortgages
  more u.k.
lenders are offering homebuyers
  fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes
  the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other
  interest rates.
and with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in
  years, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers
  trying to lock into cheap money.
the decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officials
  said, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home
  mortgage business.
while fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the u.k., they
  were the mainstay of the business in the u.s. up until only a
  few years ago.
but in the early 1980s interest rates soared.
u.s.
lenders,
  mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as low
  as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their
  portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to
  induce them to retain their accounts.
as a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were
  forced to merge.
the survivors decided to offer mortgages whose
  rates would move in line with the cost of funds.
"we very much have the example of the u.s.
thrifts in mind,"
  said a spokesman for abbey national building society,
  explaining why his institution, for the time being, is only
  offering variable rate mortgages.
the rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped
  homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders
  concede they are being forced to undercut each other still
  more.
sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier
  this week by the nation's two largest building societies and by
  national westminster bank plc reflect growing competition for
  new business, officials at all three institutions said.
the fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even
  below those on the variable rate loans.
"of course they are less profitable than other (variable
  rate) mortgages," said a spokesman for midland bank plc, which
  earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate
  new mortgage loans.
but he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable
  loans because, "it was just another way to attract people to our
  mortgage product."
trustee savings bank plc (tsb) was offering five year fixed
  rate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year.
the 100 mln stg that tsb set aside for the loans was
  exhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman.
"everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage," she said, noting
  that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct
  of its 1986 volume.
in short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they
  offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest
  rates.
if interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the
  lender is earning an above average return on assets.
but if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won
  the benefit of cheap money.
household mortgage co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed
  rate mortgage after the june 11 elections on the assumption
  that a conservative party victory would help money market rates
  fall further, according to duncan young, managing director.
young explained that the company had planned to protect
  itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a
  complicated hedging instrument.
but money market rates have risen contrary to expectations
  and the company has shelved its plans for the time being.
he
  said money market rates were too high to arrange both the
  mortgages and hedge profitably.
however, he said that when the household mortgage co does
  make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them.
this
  means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond
  and selling them to an investor.
for technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more
  efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate
  mortgages.
in the u.s., where fixed rate mortgages are popular
  again, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money
  over the past few years.
texaco &lt;txc> canada to raise crude oil postings
  texaco inc's texaco canada said it

the price hike follows a round of
  crude oil price increases started late june 17 by sun co.
the
  other major canadian crude suppliers raised prices june 18.

high water extends rhine river blockage
  rising water levels on the rhine caused by
  heavy rain are delaying an operation near karlsruhe to raise
  two sunken boats which have blocked the river's main navigation
  channel since early last week, a karlsruhe water authority
  spokesman said.
he said two floating cranes were unable to begin lifting
  the sunken tug orinoko and its lighter because the water level
  had reached 815 centimetres and was forecast to rise to 820-830
  cm by tomorrow.
he was unable to say when the operation might
  begin.
meanwhile, high water at cologne has forced vessels to
  travel at reduced speed, a water authority spokesman in cologne
  said.
but a water authority spokesman in duisburg, 60 kms north
  of cologne, said vessels there were moving normally.
fed expected to arrange system repurchases
  the federal reserve is likely to add
  temporary reserves to the banking system this morning by
  executing system repurchase agreements, economists said.
the fed faces a need to add a large volume of reserves this
  statement period to offset a drain caused by rising treasury
  balances at the fed after the june 15 tax date.
most economists are predicting over-the-weekend system
  repurchases.
but some, who see a smaller adding requirement,
  are forecasting a less aggressive combination of three- and
  six-day repos.
fed funds were trading at 6-3/4 pct, close to
  yesterday's 6.81 pct average.

greyhound said it had petitioned the interstate commerce
  commission for authority to acquire and operate trailways'
  routes, 450 of its 1200 buses and some of its terminals and

tunisia buys 150,000 tonnes french wheat
  tunisia has bought 150,000 tonnes of
  french soft wheat for august to december shipment at 76.70 dlrs
  per tonne fob with coface export credit, trade sources said.
this is the second french soft wheat export sale for the
  1987/88 season which starts on july 1 and follows a brazilian
  purchase of 150,000 tonnes.
france sold around 300,000 tonnes of soft wheat to tunisia
  during the 1986/87 season.
u.s. court upholds apex decision favoring nymex
  the u.s. court of appeals for the
  second circuit upheld a lower court decision dismissing a suit
  by apex oil co against the new york mercantile exchange and
  several oil companies.
the court, however, ruled that apex oil could pursue
  anititrust and commodities market manipulation allegations
  against belcher oil co, a unit of coastal corp &lt;cgp>.
apex oil, primarily a trading company, charged that several
  companies, including belcher, and nymex conspired to force it
  to deliver heating oil it had sold on the mercantile exchange,
  knowing apex could not make full delivery.
the nymex ordered apex to deliver four mln barrels of
  heating oil sold via a february 1982 heating oil contract.
apex
  eventually fulfilled this obligation but claimed damages.
richard wiener, attorney for apex at cadwalader wickersham
  and taft, said the company has not yet decided whether to
  pursue its case against belcher oil.
the nymex, meanwhile, has a counterclaim pending against
  apex oil, seeking an unspecified amount of attorney's fees and
  15 mln dlrs in punitive damages, according to a nymex
  spokeswoman.

  agreements for system account, a spokeswoman for the new york
  fed said.
fed funds were trading at 6-3/4 pct at the time of the
  direct injection of temporary reserves, dealers said.
economists had expected three- or six-day repurchases
  because the fed needs to add a large volume of reserves this
  statement period.

harcourt &lt;hbj> mum on reed &lt;reed.l> rumors
  harcourt brace jovanovich inc officials
  were not available for comment on market rumors that it is
  interested in acquiring reed international plc &lt;reed.l>.
officials of first boston inc, harcourt's financial
  adviser, declined comment.
a wall street arbitrageur, who owns harcourt shares, said
  the rumors did not make much sense because harcourt has
  announced a recapitalization plan to ward off a takeover
  attempt by british publisher robert maxwell.
"it's completely
  inconsistent with the recapitalization, the only way is if they
  drop the recapitalization," he said.
calls to harcourt seeking comment were not returned.
harcourt's recapitalization will come under scrutiny of a
  u.s. court in orlando, fla. monday.
the company has sought a
  declaratory judgment on convertibility of debentures due 2011
  in light of the recapitalization.
harcourt said in a statement this week that salomon
  brothers inc &lt;sb> and mutual shares corp have intervened in the
  case, claiming ownership of more than 30 mln dlrs face amount
  of the debenture.
in addition, british printing and
  communications corp, headed by maxwell, owns 9.5 mln dlrs face
  amount, harcourt said.
salomon said in a filing with the securities and exchange
  commission today that it has 21,978 of the debentures.
if the
  court decides they should be converted at par value of one dlr,
  they could be converted into 22.0 mln shares.
harcourt is asking the court to rule the company is not
  required to issue common to debenture holders who did not
  convert prior to june eight.
an increase in reed shares in london today was attributed
  by brokers to rumors of harcourt's interest and also to rumors
  that maxwell might be a buyer.
but an adviser to maxwell in new
  york said "there's no basis to think that it's us."

minnesota may consider anti-takeover amendment
  minnesota governor rudy perpich is
  considering calling a special legislative session to consider
  amendments to the state's anti-takeover statute, according to
  the governor's office.
a spokesman for the governor said nothing will be decided
  today, but said the governor will evaluate later whether to
  call a special session in the next few days.
the governor's office said the possible action was triggered
  by a proposal by dayton-hudson corp &lt;dh>, which has been the
  subject of takeover rumors.
a spokesman for the governor said
  the company proposed several amendments to perpich designed to
  make any takeover attempt in the state
  more difficult.
dayton-hudson suggested amendments be passed and instituted
  by next friday, the spokesperson said.
press reports in minneapolis newspapers this morning quoted
  several legislators as saying they were inclined to support
  legislation that would help dayton-hudson, according to a
  governor's spokesperson.
senate majority leader roger moe was quoted as saying he
  would be inclined to support any action that would help the
  company, the spokesperson said.
robert vanasek, the house speaker designate, was quoted in
  the minneapolis star and tribune as saying, "we are taking
  their (dayton-hudson) concerns very seriously and we are going
  to do what we can to help."

cold, wet weather slows beet growth in w. europe
  cold and wet weather in northern,
  western and central parts of europe continued to slow beet
  growth but plant density is reported to be good in most
  countries, sugar statistician f.o.
licht said.
temperatures were too low for the season and the rain has
  hampered field work and occasionally led to water-logged
  fields.
but in eastern and southeastern europe, warmer weather has
  boosted sugar beet growth.
weather in the soviet union also allowed good beet
  development, licht said.
in sweden beet growth has been delayed, although plant
  population is reported to be regular and good.
cool and rainy
  weather slowed beet growth in denmark and crop prospects are
  rated as slightly below normal.
in the united kingdom and ireland, it was rather cool with
  heavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth.
in france, belgium, the netherlands, and west germany, it
  was mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall which
  continued to slow down beet growth and often made field work
  impossible.
in austria, it was warm with some rainfall, which was
  favourable for beet growth, licht said.
in czechoslovakia and poland, it was mostly warm, favouring
  beet development.
but some heavy rain may have caused damage.
in the european beet growing regions of the soviet union,
  it was warm with showers over most areas and weather was
  generally good for the emergence and growth of beets.
in south eastern europe, warm weather with some rainfall
  boosted beet development.
labour trouble threatens the beet crop in spain.
disputes
  between the factories and the trade unions are threatening to
  delay the start of processing in the southern areas, where
  beets are maturing very early this year.

u.s. refuses parts of two australia beef cargoes
  u.s. agriculture department
  inspectors have refused entry to parts of two lots of

  for the department said.
she said usda has notified australia, which assured it that
  stricter controls would be implemented.
the australian government had already imposed residue

it said the division was closed as a result of
  4.6 billion dlrs in debt incurred from a leveraged buyout last

the union said it filed suit following the leveraged buyout

the leveraged buyout was implemented to ward off a bid by

african states agree to regional tariff cuts
  fifteen countries in eastern and
  southern africa have agreed to cut tariffs on regional trade by
  10 pct every two years up to 1996.
a statement by the preferential trade area (pta), which
  seeks to create a common market stretching from ethiopia in the
  north to lesotho in the south, said the governments would make
  the first tariff cut next year.
in 1996 they would assess the impact of the tariff
  reductions and work out a new timetable for the complete
  elimination of all barriers to trade by the year 2000.
the pta, set up in 1982, groups burnudi, the comoros,
  djibouti, ethiopia, kenya, lesotho, malawi, mauritius, rwanda,
  somalia, swaziland, tanzania, uganda, zambia and zimbabwe.
pta sources said the agreement averted a split between
  members wanting more progress towards free trade and weaker
  states concerned about the effects on customs revenue.
the reductions cover only a common list of 300 or so widely
  traded commodities and goods but pta sources said the
  organisation planned to expand the list to include 425 items.

u.s. oil prices strong ahead of opec meeting
  u.s. crude oil prices are at their
  highest level in more than a year ahead of next week's opec
  meeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect any
  policy changes from the session.
they said prices, which have steadily climbed since the
  organization's accord in december, have risen on technical
  factors within the market and concerns about supplies because
  of the iran-iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from the
  gulf.
the u.s. benchmark crude west texas intermediate is trading
  around 20.55 dlrs in the july contract on new york mercantile
  exchange's energy futures and in the spot market.
that is its
  highest level since january 1986.
opec conference president rilwanu lukman, who is nigeria's
  oil minister, said friday he expects the meeting in vienna to
  be brief and calm and that opec's current price and production
  agreement may only need a slight review.
although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation
  of the december agreement, oil prices continue to climb due to
  a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises.
analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon
  after the opec meeting.
at that point, barring any increased
  tension in the gulf or changes in opec's policies, prices
  should begin easing.
"opec will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed
  to in december because oil prices are firm," said john hill, a
  vice president at merrill lynch futures.
opec agreed in december to maintain official oil prices at
  18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to
  16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln
  barrels in the fourth quarter.
this agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising
  from 15 dlrs a barrel in early december.
several opec members who are price hawks, including iran,
  algeria and libya, will seek a higher official price and a
  reduction in output.
"and if u.s. west texas intermediate crude continues to
  trade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that
  opec will raise its official 18 dlrs price," said nauman
  barakat, analyst at smith barney, harris upham and co.
but most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such
  as saudi arabia, to block any changes in policy.
"the meeting will be a non-event with no change in the
  official prices because opec, and in particular the saudis, are
  committed to stabilizing the market," said rosario ilacqua,
  analyst with l.f. rothschild.
however, some analysts said opec may need to hold a meeting
  in september to re-evaluate market conditions.
overproduction by opec will become a real problem in the
  fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a
  day and iraq's pipeline through turkey brings another 500,000
  barrels to the market each day, said john lichtblau, president
  of petroleum industry ressearch foundation.
most expect saudi arabia to oppose a price increase at this
  meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to
  offset the decline in the dollar.
oil prices are denominated
  throughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,
  producers receive less money for their oil.
"the only real production restraint in opec is saudi arabia,"
  said sanford margoshes, analyst at shearson lehman brothers.
"in the second half of the year we expect the saudis not to
  produce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act
  as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two
  dlrs a barrel price increase at the december 1987 meeting," he
  said.
one uncertain factor is the course of the iran-iraq war.
"the wild card is the increased tensions in the persian
  gulf," said frank knuettel, analyst with prudential-bache
  securites.
oil tankers taking oil from iraq and kuwait have been
  regular targets for iranian planes.
the reagan administration
  is planning to put kuwait tankers under the protection of the
  u.s. flag, with naval escorts.
"extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis
  like this, and just general nervousness over an incident that
  could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up," knuettel said.
n.y. times &lt;nyt> to buy gwinnett daily news

  about 27,500 and a sunday circulation of about 30,900.
the new
  york times also said gwinnett county, a northeast suburb of

the purchase agreement includes the forsyth county news,

  treasury department that it will not include fluidized bed
  combustion technology, a method for the more efficient burning
  of solids, at its parachute creek oil shale project in colorado
  due to high costs.
under a 1985 agreement with the now-defunct u.s.
synthetic
  fuels corp, unocal said it would study using the technology at
  the oil shale plant.
in return the company would have been
  eligible for 500 mln dlrs in loan gaurantees and price supports
  from the u.s. treasury department, which took over the contract
  from the synthetic fuels corp, unocal said.
unocal said its studies showed the cost for the fluidized
  bed combustion facility would have exceeded 352 mln dlrs,
  compared with an original estimate of 260 mln dlrs.
the fluidized bed facility would have provided heat and
  electricity for the oil shale project, unocal said.
last year's fall in oil prices and the loss of investment
  tax credit under the tax reform act made the project
  uneconomical even with government price supports and loan
  guarantees, unocal said.
the parachute creek oil shale plant produces about 4,000 to
  5,000 barrels per day of crude shale oil, unocal said.

a department spokesman said the figures will probably be

platinum demand estimated 17 pct higher by 1991
  demand for platinum could reach 3.4 mln
  ounces by 1991, compared with an estimated offtake of 2.88 mln
  in 1986, chris clark, platinum marketing director for johnson
  matthey plc said.
clark told a meeting of the minerals research organisation
  in milton keynes he foresaw a 250,000 ounce increase in
  consumption for use in autocatalysts, currently the largest
  single application for platinum.
jewellery consumption is set to rise by 70,000 ounces,
  clark predicted in his speech, the text of which was released
  in london today.
clark said his forecast allowed for only a modest further
  increase in investment buying and may well be cautious.
he said south africa was the most likely source of
  additional supplies and will need to increase output by about
  500,000 ounces to meet increased demand.
the capital investment required to produce the additional
  output would be around one billion u.s. dlrs and the political
  climate may make it difficult to raise the money, he said.
the soviet union, whose exports have declined since the
  1970s, might increase sales to the west by about 50,000 ounces,
  clark said.
"the very probability of a growth in demand set against the
  massive investment required for expansion - and that expansion
  only being viable in south africa or russia - leads me to
  conclude that the price of platinum will be substantially
  underpinned in the medium to long-term," clark said.

european coffee trade proposes new quota formula
  european coffee roasters and traders
  have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating
  international coffee organization, ico, quotas, dutch coffee
  trade association chairman chairman frits van horick said.
van horick, who is a council member of the european coffee
  federation, was speaking at the end of the ecf annual meeting.
the new formula is based on six-year moving averages and
  would give brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, an
  unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current
  coffee agreement, van horick said.
if accepted by the consumer and producer members of the
  ico, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new
  agreement, van horick said.
coffee quotas were suspended in february last year when
  prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in
  brazil.
although prices are now considerably lower, consumers and
  producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction.
"brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the
  formula because it feared a lower quota.
but our proposal
  leaves it very little to object to," van horick said.
"the existing quota system is far too rigid and does not
  reflect supply and demand reality," he said.
"our formula
  builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost
  everyone."
although full implications of the new formula have still to
  be worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as
  colombia, kenya, indonesia and costa rica would get slightly
  higher quotas, while others such as the ivory coast, el
  salvador and nicaragua would lose quota share, van horick said.
because the proposal provides that future quota
  distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it
  should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing
  so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota.
"if the ico consumers accept our proposal it stands at least
  a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the
  september meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a
  new quota formula, " van horick said.
at the same time much will depend on brazil's attitude.
"brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side.
if
  there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two
  months and most other producers favour our proposal, we might
  just get an agreement," van horick added.
brazil buys french wheat at tender

malaysia to research tin, wary on veg oils tax
  malaysia is to urge fellow tin
  producing countries to contribute more money towards research
  into new uses for the metal, malaysian primary industries
  minister lim keng yaik told reuters in an interview.
lim, in brussels on a tour of europe and america, said he
  had instructed malaysia's representatives on the executive
  committee of the association of tin producing countries, atpc,
  to draw up a paper on the matter.
lim earlier met european community farm commissioner frans
  andriessen and industry commissioner karl-heinz narjes.
he said though it now appeared likely commission proposals
  for a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats would be
  defeated, he feared the commission would revive the idea.
lim noted andriessen this week promised that if the tax was
  adopted and third countries suffered export losses as a result,
  they would be compensated through access to the ec for
  alternative exports.
"since most of our products are commodity based, i cannot
  see how this would work out in our case," lim said.
malaysian palm oil exports to the ec are worth about 250
  mln dlrs a year.
the tin research proposal would be presented at an atpc
  meeting to be held in kuala lumpur in september.
"not enough research and development effort has been put in
  by tin producers and we have been pushed out by substitutes
  such as aluminium, paper and plastics," lim said.
he mentioned the use of inorganic tin in pesticides as an
  exciting possible new application.
lim said he could not estimate the amount of extra money
  which needed to be spent on research into new uses before the
  new paper was produced.
he said narjes told him there appeared no fundamental
  barriers to ec states quickly ratifying the new international
  rubber agreement, inra, although translations of the accord
  into some ec languages are still being awaited.
lim, who will sign and ratify the agreement on malaysia's
  behalf when he visits new york during his current tour, said it
  was important there should not be a long "interregnum" between
  the old agreement lapsing in october and the new one coming
  into force.
he described the present accord as a model for commodity
  agreements due to its being signed by nearly all producing and
  consuming countries and by virtue of its review systems and
  control over buffer stock management.

latin, caribbean nations oppose trade bills
  a group of latin american and
  caribbean nations formally opposed trade legislation pending in
  congress, saying it would curb their exports, slow development
  and hinder its ability to repay foreign debt.
mario rodriguez montero, president of an organization of
  american states special committee on trade, said he was aware
  of the large u.s. trade deficit, but added "the region should
  not be the one affected by the trade bills."
he said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar
  and the budget deficit, and "it is regrettable to solve it by a
  trade bill that would only serve private u.s.
interests."
rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two
  days of meetings with u.s. officials on trade bills now in
  congress that are designed to reduce the u.s. trade deficit,
  which last year hit a record 166.3 billion dlrs.
congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at
  japan, taiwan, south korea and a few other nations with large,
  annual trade surpluses with the united states.
mexico, brazil and venezuela are the only latin nations
  with large trade surpluses last year with the united states,
  but even mexico, with the largest, had a surplus of only 5.2
  billion dlrs, against japan's of 58.6 billion dlrs.
the european community has also opposed the bills.
rodriguez said the latin and caribbean nations backed the
  reagan administration's opposition to many of the sections in
  the legislation, including those to curb imports and to require
  retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices.
he told reporters the committee would likely mount a
  campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate
  on the senate floor, expected next week.
rodriguez said "the region needs trade to continue
  development.
we hope this need will not be affected negatively
  by trade legislation."
rodriguez said: "we need to keep the market opens -
  especially the u.s. market - to obtain the necessary foreign
  exchange not only to service the debt but also to continue
  national development progress."
president reagan has said he would veto any legislation he
  termed "protectionist," and his aides now are mounting a effort
  to water down some of the objectionable provisions in the
  legislation.
asked whether reagan was ready to cast a veto, rodriguez
  said as yet "the administration is not in a veto frame of mind."
reed intl denies bid approach
  reed international plc &lt;reed.l> denied
  rumours on the u.k. stock market that it was the target of a
  takeover bid and said it had received no approach.
"in view of the increase in our share price today, i want to
  make clear that we have not received any bid approaches," reed's
  chairman leslie carpenter said in a statement.
rumours that u.s.
publisher harcourt brace jovanovich inc
  &lt;hbj> might bid for reed, a paper and printing company, pushed
  reed shares up 54p at 600p at one stage today before they eased
  back to 564p at the close against a background of a widespread
  decline in u.k. equity prices.
share market analysts said speculators were buying the
  stock on belief that harcourt would bid for reed in an effort
  to escape the unwelcome two billion dlr bid from robert
  maxwell's british printing and communication corp &lt;bpcl.l>.
such a move would have made harcourt too big for bpcc to
  take it over, analysts added.
they also said there was some speculation that if bpcc's
  bid for harcourt was unsuccessful, it could turn its attention
  to reed.

colombia helpful but coffee quotas uncertain--u.s.
  a u.s. government trade official
  responsible for coffee policy said prospects for an accord on
  coffee quotas are still uncertain despite recent colombian
  efforts to bridge differences between producers and consumers.
jon rosenbaum, an assistant u.s. trade representative just
  back from trade talks in colombia, said most producing
  countries now accept some sort of standardized criteria must be
  agreed to reintroduce coffee quotas.
"there is one country which evidently still does not,"
  rosenbaum said in an obvious reference to brazil, which has
  been negative recently on a reintroduction of quotas.
rosenbaum said because of the stance of brazil the outlook
  for an agreement to reintroduce coffee quotas at the september
  international coffee organization meeting is hard to predict.
he said that during the visit to bogota he held technical
  discussions with colombian officials.
while he did not meet with jorge cardenas, head of the
  colombian coffee producers federation, who was in europe,
  cardenas left a "positive letter," rosenbaum said.
the cardenas letter responded to a u.s. letter last month
  which praised colombia for trying to find a compromise formula
  for the reintroduction of quotas, but outlined several concerns
  with the technical details of the colombian plan.
rosenbaum could not be reached later in the day for comment
  on a new formula for calculating ico quotas agreed to by
  european coffee roasters and traders.
dutch coffee trade association chairman frits van horick
  said in amsterdam the new formula is based on six year moving
  averages and would give brazil an unchanged export quota for
  the remaining to years of the current coffee agreement.
the u.s. has said it will not agree to any coffee quotas
  unless "objective criteria" which reflect recent changes in the
  coffee market are used to set export limits.
ccc credit guarantees to el salvador reallocated
  the commodity credit corporation
  (ccc) has reallocated 1.3 mln dlrs in credit guarantees
  originally granted to cover the sale of protein meals to el
  salvador so it may buy rice, the u.s. agriculture department
  said.
the action reduces the guarantee line authorized for sales
  of protein meals to 12.7 mln dlrs and creates a rice credit
  guarantee line of 1.3 mln dlrs, the department said.
all sales under the credit guarantee lines must be
  registered and exports completed by september 30, the
  department said.
international lpg prices steady in quiet market
  international lpg prices were little
  changed in the past week, barely affected by the excitement on
  the advent of opec's mid-year meeting, traders and industry
  sources said.
"if the opec decides to increase crude oil production," a
  traders said, "lpg supplies will be up without corresponding
  rise in demand."
petrochemical buyers were sidelined, after their foray in
  the market early in june, they said.
an industry meeting in dublin this week also drew many
  market participants away from the trading desk, they added.
algeria has moved at least two cargoes of propane to the
  u.s. gulf, keeping mediterranean prices steady, traders said.
in the mideast gulf, propane appeared easing slightly,
  after a major u.s. oil company bought propane on formula which
  netted back about 123 dlrs, cif mideast gulf, which was two
  dlrs below saudi arabia's government selling price (gsp),
  industry sources said.
delivered propane to japan was quoted at gsp plus 19 dlrs
  and butane at gsp plus 25 dlrs, the traders said.
kuwait seen wanting to lease some u.s. tankers
  the united states said kuwait was
  discussing plans to lease privately-owned u.s. tankers to
  transport oil through the gulf in addition to putting some of
  its own vessels under american flags.
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley, who made the
  disclosure about the tankers, also told reporters the united
  states expects to conclude very soon a favorable arrangement
  with saudi arabia concerning expanded security cooperation in
  the gulf.
the two developments occur as the reagan
  administration continued to come under fire in congress for its
  plans to bring 11 kuwaiti tankers under american flags.
the move is designed to protect the tankers from iranian
  attacks and ensure freedom of navigation in the strategic
  waterway but has raised fears on capitol hill that it will draw
  the united states into the seven-year-old iran-iraq war.
"the kuwaitis have discussed the possibility of chartering
  u.s. flag vessels with the maritime administration," oakley
  said.
she emphasized, however, that "if some charter arrangement
  could be worked out, it would not supplant the reflagging
  arrangement that we worked out with the kuwaitis."
in both cases, the ships would be eligible for u.s. navy
  escort in the gulf, she said.
the washington post today quoted john gaughan, administrator
  of the martime administration, as saying kuwait has approached
  an american shipping company about the possibility of a
  charter.
gaughan said that earlier this week he told representatives
  of the company, whose identify he did not know, that chartered
  vessels flying the u.s. flag "would be protected," the newspaper
  reported.
concerning saudi arabia, oakley said "we are moving forward
  in our talks ... on how we can tailor our efforts and security
  cooperation to facilitate our gulf operations."

  dayton hudson corp, in a

a dayton hudson spokeswoman would not identify the buyer,
  but wall street sources said dart group corp &lt;darta.o> was the
  company interested in buying dayton hudson stock.
the wall street sources said the dart group is expected
  soon to file a statement with the securities and exchange
  commission on its accumulation of dayton hudson stock.
according to the letter to company employess, dayton hudson
  management has moved in two directions to fend off a takeover.
according to the letter, chairman kenneth macke expressed to
  the group buying its stock the company's desire to remain
  independent.
dayton hudson thursday night met with minnesota governor
  rudy perpich, appealing for legislative help.
a spokesman for governor perpich earlier said the governor

minnesota house speaker designate said the legislators

group cuts zondervan&lt;zond.o> stake to 3.8 pct
  one of several investor groups
  formerly associated with london investor christopher moran in
  his unsuccessful bid to take over zondervan corp last year,
  said it cut its stake in the company to less than five pct.
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission,
  the group, led by investors lawrence altschul and james
  apostolakis, said it cut its zondervan stake to 157,500 shares,
  or 3.8 pct of the total, from 246,500 shares, or 5.9 pct.
the group, which earlier this month said in an sec filing
  it wanted join with other groups to maximize share values, said
  it sold 89,000 shares between june 9 and 15 for 1.5 mln dlrs.
the group had joined with the moran group, which last year
  assembled a combined 44 pct stake in zondervan during its
  unsuccessful takeover try.
last month, the moran group broke up and splintered into
  various factions.
moran himself withdrew from the takeover
  effort and last reported his personal stake at 4.8 pct.
a group led by miwok capital corp, a california broker with
  a 10.6 pct stake, and another one led by minneapolis
  stockbroker jeffrey wendel with 2.6 pct, have both made recent
  sec filings saying they are seeking agreements with other
  parties who may want to seek control of the company.

the mine's contract
  expires july 1 and the smelter's on july 21.
the brunswick mine produced 413,800 tonnes of zinc and
  206,000 tonnes of lead last year at a recovery rate of 70.5 pct

new leader coming to u.s. sec in challenging era
  president reagan's nominee as top
  policeman for the nation's securities markets will inherit an
  agency challenged by an insider trading scandal, wild stock
  price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the
  globalization of financial markets.
david ruder, a 58-year-old republican law professor at
  northwestern university in evanston, ill., was named thursday
  to be the 23rd chairman of the five-member u.s. securities and
  exchange commission.
if confirmed by the senate, as expected, he will succeed
  john shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a record
  six years as chairman to become ambassador to the netherlands.
the sec has been in the limelight for the past year as its
  investigators have probed into the most colossal insider
  trading scandal ever uncovered on wall street.
the investigation, which is still active, mushroomed in
  recent months as a growing number of well known traders and
  prominent investment banking firms have been charged with
  wrongdoing.
the pace of the probe picked up markedly in november after
  ivan boesky, one of wall street's most successful stock
  speculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigators
  and to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal
  profits after being charged with insider trading.
but the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new
  phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred by
  computer-driven trading strategies that span markets in 
  securities, options and futures.
the price gyrations have
  combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented
  volatility to some u.s. securities markets.
at the same time, the sec is being pressed by some
  lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate
  takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers
  steadily reshapes the u.s. corporate landscape.
and the agency is being pushed by u.s. and foreign
  exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork
  for an international securities marketplace in which trading
  occurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.
such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment
  opportunities but could strain the sec's ability to enforce
  u.s. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.
under the leadership of shad, the sec eased financial
  disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,
  eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to
  spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's
  review of hostile corporate takeovers.
shad, who had been vice chairman of the e. f. hutton
  investment banking firm, brought a wall street perspective to
  the agency upon being named chairman in 1981.
in line with the views of other top administration
  officials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover
  battles over new federal regulations.
the sec under shad also stressed prosecution of insider
  trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that
  topped the agency's enforcement agenda during the
  administration of president jimmy carter, a democrat.
securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with
  ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to
  significantly alter the commission's current priorities.
the sec currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them
  lawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that
  figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the
  agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.
the agency is one of the few in the government that
  actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past
  few years because of fees it charges public companies,
  investment banks and other securities firms it regulates.
the sec is structured as an independent regulatory agency,
  meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the
  president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing
  for policy differences alone.
by law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same
  political party, and the agency prepares its own budget request
  each year instead of leaving this to the white house.
established by congress in 1934, the sec traces its origins
  to the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed
  in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted
  market manipulations by large investment firms.
the agency requires public companies and investment
  vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on
  their financial condition and to disclose changes in their
  condition any time they issue new securities.
it requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to
  register with it and comply with investor protection rules, and
  it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.
its first chairman was joseph kennedy, an industrial
  magnate who was also the father of john kennedy, later to
  become the nation's 35th president.
other former chairmen include william douglas, who served
  from 1937 until his appointment to the u.s. supreme court in
  1939, and william casey, who served during president nixon's
  first term and was reagan's director of the central
  intelligence agency until his death earlier this year.
u.s. asks congress to revise tariff categories
  the administration asked congress to
  replace the u.s. tariff schedule with a new system to bring it
  into line with international tariff categories, u.s. trade
  representative clayton yeutter said.
the new system will add such items as fiber optics and more
  accurately define new composites, items not widely traded when
  the current schedule was devised some 30 years ago.
yeutter said the harmonized system, as the new schedule is
  called, will change tariff categories and definitions to meet
  the present-day needs of exporters and importers, but they
  should pay about the same rates of duties.
yeutter said, "american exporters will find it far easier to
  deal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety of
  differing systems which they now face."
he said the new system ended 12 years of multinational
  negotiations to create the unified tariff schedule.
yeutter said government and business moves are based on
  data from tariff schedules and the new system will improve
  knowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making.
he said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards under
  the new system, with about half expected to join the system by
  january 1988.

italy deficit not due to liberalization-minister
  italy's foreign trade minister mario
  sarcinelli, commenting on speculation in the italian press,
  said a sharp balance of payments deficit in may could not be
  attributed to recent moves liberalizing the purchase of foreign
  securities.
sarcinelli was reacting to suggestions that last month's
  overall 3,211 billion lire deficit, which compares with april's
  2,040 billion surplus, could be linked to a may 13 decree
  abolishing obligatory non-interest-bearing deposits on foreign
  securities purchases.
"the deficit can be better attributed to premature and
  delayed foreign trade payments and receipts (leads and lags)
  rather than capital outflow to portfolio investment," sarcinelli
  said in a statement.
earlier today the newspaper la repubblica cited remarks by
  the bank of italy, which announced the deficit for may and said
  it had been partly caused by "non-banking capital outflows."
"in practice, it seems that there has been a constant flow
  of capital to foreign securities or investments outside our
  borders," said the newspaper.
but the newspaper added that it was still not possible to
  say how far the move to abolish foreign securities purchase
  deposits had affected italy's balance of payments.

tenneco &lt;tgt> to transport gas on open access
  tenneco inc said tennessee gas pipeline
  co, its largest interstate natural gas pipeline, will transport
  natural gas under the open access rules of the federal energy
  regulatory commission, ferc.
in open access, gas pipelines serve purely as a transport
  company, moving gas from suppliers to customers.
pipelines also
  transport its own gas to customers.
earlier this week, transco energy co &lt;t> rejected the ferc
  guidelines, saying it would not offer open access until the
  regulatory body offers a solution to the exposure it faces for
  gas it has bought but could not sell.
the exposure faced by the industry stems from take or pay
  contracts, under which pipelines bought gas on long-term
  contracts they could not sell.
the problem grew severe as
  customers won cheaper sources of gas because of open access.
some industry analysts speculated earlier this week that
  tenneco might follow transco's lead and close its pipelines to
  open-access because of the take-or-pay issue.
but tenneco today said open access "is one of the steps
  ferc is taking to restructure the gas industry in the u.s. ferc
  is moving the industry through this restructuring now, even
  before all transitional problems are solved."
a spokesman said tenneco faces 1.7 billion dlrs in exposure
  under the take-or-pay contracts, but he had no specific figure
  for tennessee gas, which runs 2,000 miles of pipelines from
  louisiana and texas up to new england.
"we remain convinced that the most critical transitional
  issue facing the industry--take-or-pay--must be resolved by
  ferc in the near future.
"a failure to do so could have grave consequences for the
  industry's continued ability to provide its customers with
  reliable natural gas," said tennessee gas transmission co
  president r.c.
thomas.

no cominco strike talks scheduled
  cominco ltd said no
  talks were scheduled with striking workers at its trail smelter
  and kimberley, british columbia lead-zinc mine.
a company spokesman said the company and union met
  informally tuesday but talks did not constitute a formal
  bargaining session.
the last formal talks were on june 5.
the workers went on strike may 9 and production has been
  shut down since then.
the trail smelter produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and
  110,000 long tons of lead last year.
the sullivan mine at
  kimberley produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore in 1986, most for
  processing at the trail smelter.
u.s. economy slowdown raises recession fears
  the economy faces lackluster growth
  and the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement
  in u.s. exports should falter, economists say.
growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness
  in the key housing and auto sectors and could be further
  hampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say.
"these factors raise the question: is there enough strength
  to keep the economy from tipping into a recession?"
said lyle
  gramley, chief economist of the mortgage bankers
  association and a former federal reserve board official.
the commerce department said this week that the economy
  grew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, but
  a u.s. monetary official called it a weak report.
housing starts fell 2.7 pct in may, and consumer spending
  rose a weak 0.1 per cent.
"our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing --
  are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, "
  martin mauro, senior economist for merrill lynch economics,
  told reuters.
gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow
  because inflation is rising faster than real wages.
to offset this, u.s. exports must continue to rise,
  returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost
  personal income and consumption, he says.
"i expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to
  keep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,"
  gramley said.
federal reserve board governor martha seger told reporters
  that the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was the
  result of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last
  and said the recovery was showing anemia.
seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, "the pace
  of the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into
  monetary policy" - possibly a signal that the fed will be
  accommodative.
most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct
  forecast by the reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if
  the dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and add
  to the risk of a recession.
mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in may
  came despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where an
  inventory overhang still exists.
he says the boost in production came from smaller
  industries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which have
  improved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar.
"they are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in
  economic activity, but i think they will keep us out of a
  recession," mauro said.
in a speech to financial planners this week, beryl
  sprinkel, the chief white house economic adviser, predicted the
  trade deficit will continue to improve.
"prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 and
  into 1988 are still quite favorable," he said.
but private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in
  inflation.
allen sinai, chief economist at shearson lehman brothers
  inc., told congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5
  to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 after
  a 1.1 pct increase in 1986.
the rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oil
  and energy prices and rising prices for services, he said.
"the lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets
  out of the bottle, it continues to persist," he said, adding he
  would like the fed to tighten credit.
a major factor affecting inflation is the value of the
  dollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, says
  a prominent international banker.
rainer gut, chairman of credit suisse, told the national
  press club that the dollar's downward trend against the yen and
  the mark will continue for years because the united states is
  the world's largest debtor nation.
the swiss banker said the economic indicators point to a
  further slackening of activity and called naive the belief that
  the five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever.
"it is very difficult to be optimistic," gut said.
brazil could export 19 mln bags of coffee -ibc
  brazil's coffee exports could amount to
  19 mln bags this year, because of the excellent crop estimate
  of 35.2 mln bags, an ibc spokesman said.
he said exports could surpass the average annual 18 mln
  bags mark, especially if the final harvest to be conducted in
  october and november confirms the crop at over 35 mln bags.
he said the average limit of errors for the official crop
  harvest could be set at five pct above or below the first
  estimates officially published today.
he said the ibc agreed with a request by producers for the
  institute to ask the government for a monthly indexation of the
  guarantee minimum price.
investment partnership ups facet &lt;fct> stake
  charter oak partners, a connecticut
  investment partnership, said it raised its stake in facet
  enterprises inc to 480,000 shares, or 9.6 pct of the total
  outstanding common stock, from 300,000 shares, or 6.0 pct.
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission,
  charter oak said it bought 180,000 facet common shares on june
  12 at 18.25 dlrs each.
uptrend remains intact for debt futures
  the six basis point rise of the past
  month in u.s. debt futures may be extended next week by a
  series of u.s. economic reports, analysts said, as long as the
  dollar holds firm.
"interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basis
  points over the last month, largely over indications that
  inflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowing
  u.s. trade balance, in nominal terms," samuel kahan, chief
  financial economist with kleinwort benson government
  securities, said.
kahan said recent government reports have shown strength in
  the economy during the first quarter, but his concern is
  whether the u.s. economy will sustain that strength in the
  longer term.
weak u.s. economic growth could hurt the dollar, which has
  become more important to the direction of debt futures than the
  beneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy.
the median trade expectations for tuesday's u.s. consumer
  price index and durable goods reports are up 0.4 pct and down
  1.5 pct, respectively.
meanwhile, the eight billion dlr drop in the m-1 money
  supply announced this week was "surprising, much larger than
  expected," according to kahan.
"unless quickly reversed," such
  a trend "will ensure that june m-1 growth will be negative,"
  kahan said.
taken in conjunction with m-2 and m-3 aggregates which
  kahan said have "slowed to a crawl, below federal reserve board
  annual targets," the consequences could be a hint of economic
  weakness down the road, he said.
based on chart formations, t-bond futures may be poised for
  further gains, although the advance has been slowed recently,
  analysts said.
september t-bonds "are up almost six points since about may
  18," merrill lynch debt analyst jim duggan noted.
september
  bond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93
  in mid-june, duggan said.
while follow-through buying has aided the advance so far,
  and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide through
  chart support, the rally in september t-bonds has been thwarted
  above the 93 level.
"the 93 level is formidable resistance and must be taken
  out before this activity is anything other than a trading range
  market," carroll mcentee and mcginley futures debt analyst
  brian singer said.
the dollar remains the key fundamental factor, and the u.s.
  currency has made little headway of late, analysts said.
"the critical variable remaining in the market is the value
  of the dollar," kahan said.
additional influences next week will be possible
  developments ahead of an opec members meeting, and the impact
  and size of the u.s. budget deficit, "although these will not
  be in the forefront of the market early next week," kahan said.
in looking ahead to the u.s. treasury mini-refunding
  auctions of 24.25 billion in t-notes on tuesday, wednesday and
  thursday, singer said the market will likely greet the results
  with little excitement.
however, a successful auction could
  prove to be a turning point, depending on prevailing market
  psychology.

venezuela probes alleged foreign exchange fraud
  banking authorities and police are
  investigating an alleged fraud by the second largest trading
  house in the caracas free foreign exchange market, finance
  minister manuel azpurua told reporters.
the superintendency of banks and the technical and judicial
  police have both begun probes of cambio la guiara, azpurua said
  on friday night.
police said the owners of the firm, mario muggia and his
  brother luigi muggia, have left venezuela.
cambio la guiara operated in part on the "parallel market" in
  which traders buy and sell dollars among themselves.
the venezuelan central bank on june 17 suspended the
  licences of all 21 foreign exchange operators in the parallel
  market, blaming their speculation for the constant rise in the
  value of the u.s. dollar here.
juan domingo cordero, vice-president of the caracas stock
  exchange and the owner of a foreign exchange trading house,
  said on friday he had begun legal action against cambio la
  guiara for issuing him four checks without funds for a total
  amount of almost one mln dlrs.
the cambio la guiara exchange house had operated in
  venezuela for more than 20 years.
kuwait says it has full gulf arab support
  kuwait, whose shipping has come under
  repeated attack by iran, has the full support of saudi arabia
  and other gulf allies, a senior government official said.
cabinet spokesman abdul-aziz al-otaibi, quoted by the
  kuwaiti news agency kuna yesterday, said foreign minister
  sheikh sabah al-ahmed al-sabah had told cabinet he had found
  "complete support...at this delicate phase" during visits to gulf
  cooperation council (gcc) states.
the gcc, an economic and military alliance which has
  generally supported iraq over iran, comprises bahrain, kuwait,
  oman, qatar, saudi arabia and the united arab emirates.
santos says it has significant oil find
  santos ltd &lt;stos.s> said it had made a
  significant oil discovery at its mawson one well in the moomba
  block of the cooper basin, south australia.
it said the well flowed oil from sands at an average rate
  of 1,440 barrels per day from 2,131 to 2,135 metres through a
  6mm choke.
santos said the well was cased and suspended pending
  further evaluation.
but it said the proximity of the discovery
  to existing production facilities at the gidgealpa south field
  would allow mawson one to be brought into production rapidly.
santos has a 60 pct stake in the block, &lt;delhi petroleum
  pty ltd> has 30 pct and &lt;south australian oil and gas corp pty
  ltd> has 10 pct.
oil markets show respect for new opec accord
  opec has shown itself to be in control
  of the world oil situation with its speed in hammering out a
  pact to limit crude oil output to 16.6 mln barrels per day
  (bpd) for the rest of 1987, oil traders said.
they said market respect for the cartel has increased since
  it announced saturday that it would cut fourth quarter output
  to 16.6 mln bpd from the 18.3 mln agreed in december.
"there are light oversupplies now, but opec ... has ensured
  there will be no oversupplies in the fourth quarter, and is in
  effect putting pressure on end-users," a european crude oil
  trader said.
in tokyo, one oil analyst said, "there's no reason to expect
  a weak market from now on."
a japanese oil trader, also based in tokyo, said, "we
  thought opec would have difficulty agreeing on fourth quarter
  production so the market will react very bullishly."
traders in singapore said that while there has been only a
  slight increase so far in spot quotes for dubai, a benchmark
  crude, they expect price increases over the next few days.
august dubai was discussed in cautious early activity at
  around 17.35 dlrs, above friday's 17.15-20 range, but still
  below the government selling price (gsp) of 17.42.
even prices of light mideast grades, such as qatar and abu
  dhabi crudes, are expected to improve from recent weak
  positions, 15 to 20 cents below their gsp's.
singapore traders
  said sellers might now aim for gsp's at least.
they said that after initial jumps, they expect prices to
  stabilise and hover around gsps for the next few months.
they said the japanese oil market would be most affected
  and japanese end-users would need to rebuild stocks for winter
  requirements before october.
prices are most likely to rise in the fourth quarter on
  european and u.s. stockbuilding for winter, they added.
"there's no doubt consumption will be higher than production
  by the fourth quarter and stocks are not that high," said an
  international trader in tokyo.
another tokyo trader was less
  bullish, "for sure there will be some shortage but it depends on
  how much they (opec members) cheat."
a singapore trade source said, "there is enough cheating and
  leakage in the opec sales system to convince traders there is
  no need to worry about shortages."
other traders said the questionable iraqi production level,
  after iraq's rejection of its assigned quota, was a bearish
  factor to be considered.
traders also said end-users now would buy as much as
  possible on term contracts and buy spot only when the market
  cooled from its initial reaction to the opec agreement.
spot product prices in singapore were little changed in
  thin early discussions, with naphtha and middle distillates
  quiet on minimal buying interest.
fuel oil products were steady to firm on light demand and
  tight prompt supplies, dealers said.
far east traders expect 20 dlr oil in january
  opec's agreement to limit output to 16.6
  mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boost
  spot prices and enable the group to raise its official
  reference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in january from the current
  18 dlrs, far east oil industry sources said.
"fundamentally, the market situation is bullish and the
  official price will be 20 dlrs in january," a japanese refiner
  said.
the sources said that in spite of over-production by opec
  members such as iraq, the united arab emirates, kuwait and
  qatar, demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter.
spot oil prices surged on friday in late u.s. trading as
  the market anticipated an opec agreement on second-half 1987
  output.
in early tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrs
  for mideast dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs for
  u.k. brent, traders said.
they said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into
  the u.s. market as the benchmark crude west texas intermediate
  (wti) trades at around 20.30 dlrs.
"with wti at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, u.s.
refiners will import
  mideast and far east crudes and this will strengthen those
  grades further," said a japanese oil trader.
some tokyo traders were cautious about whether thu spot
  market has further upward potential in the short term, having
  risen strongly on the opec news on friday.
"you could certainly argue that if new york rose on that
  basis, there's no reason for prices to go up again today," said
  one international oil trader in tokyo.
"but i think if there's any sign of a dip, it will be bought
  back up again pretty quickly," he added.
one oil industry analyst concurred, "there is no reason to
  expect a weak market from now on."
he said he expected opec to
  raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on december 9.
oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly
  in the next few months due to cheating by some opec members and
  the likelihood that saudi arabia will act as swing producer to
  maintain steady prices.
iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day
  compared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said.
its
  export capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipeline
  through turkey, comes onstream in or around september.
qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd,
  against its opec-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting up
  to 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said.
iran, the united arab emirates and kuwait are also cheating
  on the opec agreement with over-production and effective price
  discounts through counter-purchases, industry sources said.
but
  they mostly agreed that saudi arabia will unofficially act as
  swing producer, cutting production to compensate for higher
  output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise
  too high too fast.
saudi arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln
  barrels.
"saudi arabia wants oil price stability so the
  stockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises
  too much," an oil industry analyst said.
japan to ratify 1986 international cocoa agreement
  japan will ratify the 1986 international
  cocoa agreement (icca), with effect from july 1, and will renew
  its membership in the international cocoa organisation (icco),
  foreign affairs ministry officials said.
they said japan would participate in an icco meeting on
  july 13 in london to revise icco buffer stock policy.
the 1986 icca has been in effect since january 1987.
government approval to participate in the icco was delayed
  by parliamentary debate over the sales tax issue, the officials
  said.

saudi oil company gets new acting governor
  the acting governor of saudi arabia's
  state-owned oil company, petromin, jamal hassan jawa, has
  retired at his own request, oil industry sources said.
they said ali ibrahim rubaishi, head of organisation
  planning in petromin, would take over as acting governor.
jawa held the post since his predecessor, abdul-hadi taher,
  left in a major oil industry shake up last december.
the sources said rubaishi had not been expected to hold the
  post permanently.
the government removed taher and oil minister ahmed zaki
  yamani from their posts late last year in a move which industry
  sources said was aimed at coming to grips with a buyers' oil
  market.
the two men had run the saudi oil industry for more than 20
  years.
industry sources said that despite huge resources, saudi
  arabia had been unable to mould an oil marketing strategy tuned
  to the competitive realities of the 1980s glut.
hisham nazer, who replaced yamani, successfully led an
  opec-engineered return to fixed oil prices of 18 dlrs a barrel
  last december.
nazer is believed to be reviewing saudi oil operations
  which could lead to a thorough overhaul in the way saudi arabia
  does business, the sources said.
the sources had said possible candidates for the governor's
  job include prince abdul aziz ibn salman ibn abdul aziz, who
  earlier ran a research center at saudi arabia's university of
  petroleum and minerals, and former deputy planning minister
  faisal beshir.
they also list abdulla bakr, president of the
  university of petroleum and minerals, economist ali jonahi,
  ahmed shinawi, and zuheir masoud, director of jeddah islamic
  port.
uae oil minister oteiba visits egypt - agency
  uae oil minister mana said al-oteiba
  arrived in alexandria last night for a visit to egypt, the
  national middle east news agency (mena) said.
it said oteiba, who had just attended the opec ministerial
  meeting in vienna, would stay for several days but gave no
  details.
non-opec egypt has pledged to restrain output to support
  opec's moves to boost oil prices.
oil minister abdel hadi
  kandeel last week said egypt plans to leave its oil production
  of 870,000 barrels per day unchanged for the next five years.
egypt is able to produce up to one mln bpd.
willis faber bids for stewart wrightson
  willis faber plc &lt;wifl.l> will make an
  agreed 302.6 mln stg offer for fellow insurance broker &lt;stewart
  wrightson plc>, a joint statement said.
the offer would be on the basis of three willis shares for
  every two in stewart, valuing each stewart share at about
  655.5p.
willis already owns 2.05 mln shares, or 4.62 pct, and has
  received acceptances from stewart's directors for a further
  247,469 shares.
full acceptance of the offer would involve the issue of
  66.2 mln new willis shares, or 28.2 pct of the enlarged total.
the companies said the proposed merger would bring together
  businesses that were largely complementary.
both believed the
  combination would permit more effective competition throughout
  the world and enahnce the service provided to clients.
following the merger, the two companies saw significant
  opportunities for growth in brokerage income and considerable
  scope for improved operating efficiency.
willis shares were suspended on friday at 437p.
when
  trading restarted they dropped sharply to 393p.
stewart wrightson shares rose to 576p at 0835 gmt from a
  suspension price of 499p.
norway extends 7.5 pct oil output cut - ministry
  norway will extend its 7.5 pct cutback in
  planned north sea oil output in support of opec from july 15
  until the end of this year, oil ministry spokesman egil helle
  told reuters.
"we took a very positive view of the opec meeting in vienna,"
  he said.
"the accord reached there means stability in the oil
  market and we shall continue making our contribution."
the cuts, originally brought in from february 1, would
  probably be officially approved on july 10 by parliament, helle
  said.
the ministry had written to norway's oil companies and
  would now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts.
opec agreed this weekend in vienna on an output ceiling of
  16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and
  retained the fixed prices that were set in its december accord
  based on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point.
opec's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, and
  it's december pact had provisionally set a third quarter
  ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth
  quarter.
norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore
  fields, previously said it would continue its output curbs from
  planned production for the rest of the year if opec remained
  within its december accord on output and prices.
norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around
  840,000 bpd in 1986.
since then it has risen to around one mln
  bpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995.
the 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since
  february reduced norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd.
norway's oil minister arne oeien, currently in iceland for
  a meeting of nordic ministers, has made no official statement
  on the latest oil production cutbacks.
over the past year several other leading non-opec
  producers, including the soviet union, mexico, china, malaysia
  and egypt have also pledged support for opec's bid to keep
  prices stable.
norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an
  opec agreement last december which boosted oil prices to around
  18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last december.
norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export
  earnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price
  during the first half of 1986.
but firmer oil prices since then have brought some
  stability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade
  deficit.
norway's north sea neighbour britain has consistently
  refused to cooperate with opec output cuts saying it is up to
  the producing oil companies to set the levels of production.
brent to buy lonrho division, proposes rights
  &lt;brent walker group plc> said it had
  agreed to buy the group of companies comprising lonrho plc's
  &lt;lrho.l> metropole casino division, together with a freehold in
  central london, for 121.55 mln stg.
payment will be in cash on completion except for three mln
  stg payable on december 1, 1988.
brent said it also proposed to raise about 126 mln stg net
  through the issue of 131.67 mln convertible shares at one stg
  each.
the shares can be converted between 1990 and 2002 at the
  rate of four ordinary shares for every 15 convertibles held.
on full conversion, the issued ordinary share capital of
  the company would increase by some 64 pct.
&lt;birdcage walk ltd>, a company controlled by the walker
  family, owns 20.68 pct of the shares and is entitled to 27.2
  mln convertible shares under the offer.
the trustees had
  indicated that it intended to sell enough of the convertibles,
  nil paid, to enable it to take up the remainder.
brent would buy the casino companies and the freehold of
  45, park lane in london.
under the arrangements, it would also
  arrange for the repayment of 6.45 mln stg in inter-company
  debt.
brent walker shares firmed sharply on the announcement to
  385p from 353p at friday's close, while lonrho also firmed, to
  275p from 265.5p.
bank of japan determined to keep easy money policy
  the bank of japan bought 100 billion yen
  in certificates of deposit (cds) via repurchase agreements
  today to show its determination to maintain an easy money
  policy, central bank officials said.
"today's cd buying operation was designed to seek an
  announcement effect, in which we would reassure the market of
  the fact that we have not changed our policy stance," a senior
  central bank official told reuters.
the bank also bought 400 billion yen in two-month
  commercial bills to smooth out tight credit conditions in the
  interbank market today, the officials said.
the central bank was concerned about growing market
  expectations of higher interest rates, which were in part
  responsible for the recent plunge in stock and yen bond prices,
  the officials said.
but money traders said the market generally shrugged off
  the bank's cd operation because it was small and at a rate far
  below prevailing market rates.
the rate on the key three-month
  cds in the primary market was 4.08/00 pct, while the bank's bid
  was 3.75 pct, they said.
the bank's bill buying operation also had little impact
  because it was regarded as a routine operation, they said.
the money traders said they regarded the central bank's cd
  buying operation as simply a gesture to live up to japan's
  pledge to guide interest rates lower and stimulate the economy.
"we did not expect the central bank to ease its credit grip
  any further," a bank manager said, adding that the prevailing
  market expectation of higher rates will remain.
"if this is the case, the three-month cd rate will stay
  above four pct for the time being," he said.
bank of japan to sell 1,200 billion yen in bills
  the bank of japan will tomorrow sell 1,200
  billion yen in bills from its holdings to help absorb a
  projected money market surplus of 2,100 billion, money market
  traders said.
of the total, 800 billion yen will yield 3.6004 pct on
  sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in
  34-day repurchase agreements maturing on august 3.
the other 200 billion yen will yield 3.6003 pct in 43-day
  repurchase accords maturing on august 12.
the remaining 200 billion yen will yield 3.6503 pct in
  50-day repurchase agreements maturing on august 19.
the repurchase agreement yields compare with the 3.5625 pct
  one-month commercial bill discount rate today and 3.6250 pct on
  two-month bills.
they attributed the projected surplus mainly to 1,900

ec presidency prepared to drop oils and fats tax
  belgium, current holder of the european
  community presidency, appears ready to drop a controversial
  oils and fats tax from this year's hotly-contested farm price
  package, diplomats said.
in a discussion document prepared for today's summit
  meeting of ec leaders, belgium proposed the so-called
  "stabilising mechanism" be the subject of "further study and
  consultation with the community's main trading partners."
the proposal for a tax of as much as 330 ecus per tonne on
  both imported and domestically-produced vegetable and marine
  oils and fats has attracted a storm of international criticism.
the discussion document, aimed at preventing a cash row at
  the summit and breaking the deadlock at this year's farm price
  talks, contained the first formal reference to dropping the
  measure.
britain and denmark, which assumes the ec presidency on
  june 30, have led the opposition to the measure.
they are
  supported by west germany and the netherlands and, to a lesser
  extent, spain.
although the paper was not universally welcomed, diplomats
  said, the proposal to postpone consideration of the tax for a
  further six months was certain to survive any redrafting.

bangladesh's trade gap to widen in 1987/88
  bangladesh's trade gap is expected to
  widen in fiscal 1987/88 beginning on july 1 after the
  government relaxed restrictions on some imports including
  luxury cars.
the country has set its export target for the year at 1.1
  billion u.s. dlrs against imports of 1.805 billion dlrs,
  compared with 1986/7's one billion dlrs of export earnings and
  1.113 billion dlrs of imports.
commerce minister mohammad abdul munim said the changes
  were aimed at encouraging export oriented industries to boost
  foreign exchange earnings and imports of essential machinery
  and raw materials, to increase industrial production.
the government was easing procedures to enhance incentives
  especially for exporters of textiles and frozen food and
  importers of industrial machinery and raw materials, munim told
  reporters.
commerce ministry officials told reuters the import policy
  covered only commercial imports amounting to 1.805 billion
  dlrs.
imports of capital machinery and foodgrains by the
  government were not included in the policy, they added.
they said the country's total import bill (both commercial
  and other imports) was expected to reach 2.7 billion dlrs in
  the new year compared with 2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87.
the minister said ending restrictions on imports of cars
  and dropping 50 pct sales tax on small cars would not harm the
  economy.
munim said bangladesh feared a further drop in prices for
  its main export jute, "which will certainly affect our export
  earnings" in the coming year.
bangladesh's jute exports fell to 410 mln dlrs from 500 mln
  in 1986/87, according official figures.
but munim said exports of non-traditional items, which
  accounted for over 40 pct of total exports this year, would
  play a key role in achieving the 1987/88 export target.
china aluminium venture aims at south korea
  china and australia's victoria state
  signed a joint venture contract for a 290 mln dlr aluminium
  processing plant in china that will export to south korea,
  australian officials told journalists.
china has no official direct trade or government ties with
  seoul, while it maintains close links with north korea.
china international trust and investment corporation
  (citic) would have 75 pct of the equity in &lt;bohai aluminium
  industries ltd>, the company to build the rolling mill and
  extrusion plant on the northeast china coast, they said.
it was china's largest joint venture so far, they said.
"a joint venture opens up the potential for penetrating
  markets that would not otherwise be possible (for china),"
  victoria state treasurer rob jolly said.
an australian diplomat said citic was eager to pursue south
  korean markets.
indirect trade between china and seoul is
  growing but is not officially publicised.
victoria's &lt;aluvic ltd>, on behalf of the state government,
  will hold a 25 pct equity stake in the project, which is
  intended as a sister plant to victoria's portland aluminium
  smelter.
citic in may agreed to invest about 80 mln dlrs in
  portland.
the china-based joint venture would process portland
  aluminium and aim to sell aluminium products to the domestic
  chinese market as well as for export, jolly said.
the australian side's investment was limited to about 22
  mln dlrs, but aluvic would have the right to appoint key
  managers, he said.
australian officials said they hoped the goodwill generated
  by their participation would lead to further citic investment
  in victoria.
the chinese group enjoys a high level of
  independence from peking's central government and has extensive
  overseas investments.
norway central bank sells crowns to ease pressure
  norway's central bank sold crowns in the
  open market in a bid to ease strong upward pressure on the
  currency, which threatens to rise above set levels in a basket
  of currencies, dealers said.
the central bank declined comment, but dealers noted the
  bank had also intervened and sold small amounts of crowns on
  friday.
the bank is committed to defending the crown at certain
  levels in a basket of 14 trade-weighted currencies.
"they've been in again this morning, selling piecemeal
  whenever they think necessary," a senior dealer at an oslo bank,
  who declined to be identified, told reuters.
the crown's index is currently around 109.60 in the basket
  -- close to its upper limit of 109.50 which the central bank is
  committed to defending.
a low index figure indicates a high value for the crown.
the limit at the other end of the scale is set at 114.50.
the crown has been bolstered by high norwegian interest
  rates, currently around 16 pct in the money market, and better
  than expected economic indicators which showed a sharply
  reduced foreign trade deficit in may and inflation stabilising
  around the current annual rate of 10 pct.

ec, u.s.
remain divided over pasta dispute
  top-level talks last week between the
  european community (ec) and the united states failed to resolve
  a dispute over pasta which may provoke new trade frictions next
  month, diplomatic sources said.
the u.s.
insists the ec complies with what it regards as an
  unambiguous ruling from the world trade body gatt and
  dismantles an export subsidy system which has led to italy
  taking an increasing share of the u.s.
pasta market.
the sources said the ec, which currently provides subsidies
  of around 16 cents a pound, offered a compromise in last week's
  talks in brussels but that this was rejected by the u.s.
      u.s. assistant special trade representative jim murphy has
  returned to washington ahead of a theoretical july 1 deadline
  for agreement, set last august when the two sides resolved a
  related dispute over ec restrictions on u.s. citrus imports.
the diplomatic sources said the citrus issue could be
  reopened if the pasta dispute was not solved quickly.
it was
  also possible the u.s. would reimpose a 40 pct tariff on ec
  pasta, lifted when the citrus row was settled.
but the two sides may agree to extend the deadline for a
  few days as ec commissioners willy de clercq and frans
  andriessen are due to visit washington from july 7 to 10.

polish farm prices and costs to rise from july
  polish farmers will receive price rises
  ranging from 13.4 pct for some crops to 23.3 pct for meat from
  july 1, the finance and agriculture ministries said.
the state procurement price for rape will rise 13.4 pct to
  5,500 zloties per quintal, while wheat and rye will go up an
  average 18.2 pct to 3,100 and 2,400 zloties per quintal.
pork
  will rise by 18.8 pct and beef 23.3 pct.
the ministries said the new prices aimed to ensure farmers'
  profits and meet higher living costs.
but at the same time they
  said fertilisers would rise by an average 50 pct, animal feeds
  by 38 pct and tractors by 25 pct.
ec farm ministers to meet tomorrow after summit
  european community agriculture
  ministers will meet tomorrow evening, after the end of a
  two-day summit meeting of heads of government, to again attempt
  to agree a 1987/88 farm price package, an ec commission
  spokesman said.
he added that tomorrow's ec official journal will contain
  notice of special agricultural measures of a purely technical
  nature which will come into effect on july 1 unless the
  ministers reach an accord.
the spokesman declined to detail these special measures but
  said they would not be the sort of "dynamic" moves which ec farm
  commissioner frans andriessen has said he would take in the
  case of complete deadlock among farm ministers.
these moves would be taken only if tomorrow's meeting of
  ministers in brussels again fails to reach an accord, ec
  sources said.
andriessen is thought to be prepared to cut cereals prices
  by seven pct and to take other drastic action, trade sources
  said.
ec farm ministers ended their last meeting on june 18 still
  split over the commission's proposal for a tax on vegetable and
  marine oils and fats.
in addition, west germany said it would veto plans for
  cereal price cuts and for a change in the green currency
  system.
earlier today, diplomats said belgium, the current holder
  of the european community presidency, appears ready to drop the
  plans for the controversial oils and fats tax.
canada threatens ban on danish pigmeat imports
  canada has threatened to stop imports
  of danish pigmeat from july 14 after canadian veterinary
  inspectors approved only two of 33 slaughterhouses, a danish
  agriculture ministry official told reuters.
the canadians postponed the original july 1 deadline at the
  request of the european commission, which denmark approached
  for support.
danish foreign minister uffe ellemann-jensen said in an
  interview with the daily berlingske tidende: "denmark will not
  accept a ban on danish meat exports, and i am sure we can reach
  an understanding with the canadians with the help of the ec."
danish pigmeat exports to canada were worth 106 mln crowns
  in 1986, while canadian exports to the european community
  totalled about 6.5 billion u.s. dlrs.
some danish slaughterhouse officials expressed suspicion
  that the canadian action was in response to tightening up by ec
  veterinary inspectors on canadian food exports to the ec.
but an official at the canadian embassy in copenhagen said
  the inspection of danish slaughterhouses was based on ec
  regulations.
"canadian officials are very concerned about the
  trade implications.
we are holding active discussions with the
  ec and bilaterally," she added.
extracts from opec communique
  following are extracts from the
  communique issued at the conclusion of the opec conference
  here.
"the conference expressed satisfaction about the positive
  results of the agreement signed in december, 1986, by which
  opec re-established the system of fixed price at a level of 18
  dlrs per barrel supported by opec production ceilings
  distributed into national production levels.
"the conference noted that all market indicators, including
  spot prices in the market and netback values of all opec
  crudes, have been firming up significantly, thus consolidating
  the opec price structure as defined by the agreement."
"the conference examined the supply/demand outlook for the
  second half of the year and decided that in order to secure
  continued firm prices in the market, opec production during the
  fourth quarter of 1987 will be equal to that of the third
  quarter, i.e.
16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd), distributed into
  the same national production levels as were defined by the
  above-mentioned agreement for that quarter."
"furthermore, the conference decided to establish a
  committee of five heads of delegation to monitor the price
  evolution in the market in relation to the opec official prices
  in order to secure price stability around the opec price
  structure.
"should there be any significant change in market prices,
  the committee would immediately call for an extraordinary
  meeting of the conference with a view to deciding on the
  necessary opec production levels during the second half of the
  year, which would secure the desired market stability."
"the conference reiterated the necessity of member
  countries' strict adherence to the agreement signed in december
  1986, both in terms of official price, and national production,
  levels.
"for this purpose, the conference decided to establish a
  committee of three heads of delegation to undertake visits to
  member countries in order to motivate them to comply with the
  terms of the agreement."
"moreover, the conference stressed the necessity of the
  cooperation of the oil-producing exporting countries outside
  opec as an essential prerequisite for a lasting market
  stability.
the conference, therefore, decided to reinstate the group
  of five heads of delegation established by the 77th
  (extraordinary) meeting of the conference in april, 1986 to
  undertake the necessary contacts with those countries.
"the conference observed the continued fall in the value of
  the u.s. dollar and agreed that the matter should be studied
  and reported to the next meeting of the conference."
"the conference discussed the appointment of the secretary
  general and decided to discuss the matter again in its next
  ordinary meeting.
"the conference extended the term of office of fadhil
  al-chalabi as deputy secretary general for a period of one year
  from october 7, 1987.
"the next ordinary meeting of the conference will be
  convened in vienna on december 9, 1987."
poehl speaks against german interest rate cut
  bundesbank president karl otto poehl said
  west germany would be badly advised to lower interest rates and
  that he believed the economy would continue to recover after a
  six-month lull.
asked by the newspaper bild am sonntag if lower interest
  rates could boost the domestic economy, poehl said: "we would be
  badly advised if we forced further interest rate cuts.
"this could, under certain circumstances, release new
  inflationary fears which would then be more likely to lead to
  higher interest rates," he added.
poehl said germany had practically no growth in the past
  six months because of the mark's surge and the cold winter.
"but since april, statistics clearly show that the economy
  finds itself on a course of growth," he said.
"i expect this
  development to continue in the coming months."
asked about his expectations of a u.s.-european community
  trade war, poehl said such an event would be disastrous.
"for this reason we in europe must avoid everything used by
  protectionist forces in the u.s. as pretexts," he added.
"this
  includes...eliminating existing restrictions in the ec as far
  as possible.
protectionism is not found only in the u.s."
kuwait sees opec output over ceiling to end-year
  opec output for the second half of 1987,
  including that of iraq, will be above the official 16.6 mln
  barrels per day (bpd) output ceiling agreed by opec saturday,
  kuwait oil minister sheikh ali al-khalifa al-sabah, said.
iraq refused to sign the pact, by which opec maintained its
  ceiling at 16.6 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quarters
  of 1987.
in december, opec set a provisional fourth quarter
  level of 18.3 mln bpd, now cut back to the third quarter
  target.
ali told a news conference that including iraq, "opec third
  quarter output will be between 17.5 and 17.7 mln bpd while
  fourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd"
      ali did not detail what effect he thought these production
  levels would have on prices.
iraq has an official first half quota of 1.466 mln bpd,
  rising to 1.54 mln in the second half, but has refused to
  adhere to it and has recently been producing around two mln
  barrels per day, exporting it through pipelines to saudi arabia
  and turkey.
iraq's export capacity will be further boosted when
  a 500,000 bpd oil pipeline via turkey comes on stream in about
  september.
iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its gulf war
  enemy iran, which has a quota of 2.255 mln bpd, rising to 2.369
  mln in the second half.
ali said the position of the 400,000 bpd production from
  the neutral zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, which has
  been supplied to iraq as war relief crude, was fixed.
"we will
  not discuss it.
there will not be any change," he said.
ali said the conference, which began thursday and ended
  saturday evening, had been too short for all necessary problems
  to be adressed.
"we are overdoing it in holding too short a
  meeting.
we sweep a lot under the carpet," he said.
ali said the problem of price differentials between the
  prices of various opec crudes had not been dealt with properly
  at the meeting.
ali said "the problem of differentials is a real one.
i
  would hate to be producing today a light crude and that problem
  has not been dealt with properly.
light crudes are overpriced
  relative to heavy crudes."
asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at the
  next opec meeting to be held in vienna on december 9, ali said
  "if my crudes are affected i will raise the issue, i will not do
  the work of another minister."
kuwait's own crudes range from medium to heavy grades.
opec reintroduced fixed prices on february 1, with a spread
  of 2.65 dlrs a barrel between its lightest and heaviest crudes.
iraq rejects new opec oil quota
  iraq has rejected its new opec
  production quota set in vienna for the second half of this
  year, the official iraqi news agency ina reported.
it quoted oil minister issam abdul-rahim al-chalabi, who
  returned sunday, as saying "iraq will continue to adhere to its
  position considering itself as not included in the agreement."
last december, iraq rejected its assigned first half 1987
  quota of 1.466 mln bpd and demanded a share equal to the 2.255
  mln bpd quota set for iran, its enemy in the nearly
  seven-year-old gulf war.
the accord reached by opec ministers in vienna saturday set
  an output ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd for the group's 13 members
  from july to december, raising iraq's share to 1.54 mln bpd and
  iran's to 2.369 mln.

ivory coast weather no problem for 1986/87 crops
  ivory coast rainfall this season has
  been less than in previous years, but 1986/87 cocoa and coffee
  production has not suffered, the official ivorian daily
  fraternite matin reported.
the newspaper did not speculate on whether recent dry
  conditions seriously threatened the main 1987/88 cocoa crop.
trade sources said the weather up to now could be irrelevant if
  there is good rainfall in coming weeks.
precipitation during the present campaign has been lowest
  in northern savannah regions, where the cotton crop has
  especially benefitted from the dry weather, fraternite matin
  said.
agriculture minister denis bra kanon said earlier this
  month 1986/87 cotton output would be a record 213,506 tonnes,
  compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985/86.
fraternite matin said the mainstays of ivorian agriculture
  had been little affected by the dry weather.
coffee does not
  need very much water to survive and only old cocoa plants have
  been affected in some regions, it added.
london-based dealer gill and duffus recently forecast
  1986/87 ivory coast cocoa output at a record 590,000 tonnes,
  which compares with 585,000 estimated for 1985/86.
it described
  early development of the new main crop as patchy.
the u.s. agriculture department (usda) earlier this year
  forecast a drop in 1986/87 coffee production in the ivory coast
  due to drought in the western part of the country.
it estimated
  the crop at 3.84 mln bags compared with the previous year's
  4.33 mln bag harvest.
ivorian officials have only described this year's coffee
  crop as "normal."

armistice eludes ec and u.s.
in spaghetti war
  talks between the european community
  (ec) and the united states have failed to settle a trade
  dispute over pasta, an ec commission spokesman said.
diplomatic sources said the dispute could provoke new trade
  friction unless it was settled soon.
washington is insisting that the ec comply with what it
  regards as an unambiguous ruling from the world trade body gatt
  and cut export subsidies which have allowed italy to take an
  increasing share of the u.s. pasta market.
the ec provides subsidies of about 16 cents a pound on
  pasta exports.
the spokeswoman said the talks foundered on the
  question of how much the subsidy should be cut.

the figure of 100 represents normal in a year of average growth
  conditions with no crop damage.
the test gave ratings expressed as a factor of 100, as
  follows - winter wheat 96 (last year 91), winter rye 97 (98),
  winter barley 92 (90), spring barley 94 (98), oats 96 (98),

india relaxes rules for export promotion
  the reserve bank of india, rbi,
  announced new rules to allow exporters of 25 products to use
  foreign exchange up to 10 pct of their firm's total annual
  export earnings for export promotion abroad.
the move is designed by the government to improve india's
  trade deficit.
products eligible for the new blanket exchange permit
  scheme include tea bags, cigarettes, coffee, leather, various
  textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics, engineering and
  electronic goods, ready-made garments, processed food, sports
  goods, fabricated mica and consultancy services.
the scheme replaces current rules which allow different
  amounts of foreign exchange to be used only when firms attain a
  minimum annual turnover prescribed for each product.
rbi said under the new rule, 16 other products will
  qualify, on a discretionary basis, for overseas promotional
  spending of not more than two pct of the freight-on-board value
  of annual export earnings.
these include oil cakes, cereals, raw cotton, raw and
  semi-processed leather, gems, castor and sandalwood oil,
  psyllium husks and seeds, opium and various mineral ores.
rbi said exporters of products not covered by either of the
  two groups will be eligible to use up to five pct of their
  freight-on-board value of their annual export earnings.
industry sources said the new entitlements, considerably
  higher than the previous limits, are also more flexible because
  holders of new permits no longer need to frequently apply to
  rbi for release of foreign exchange for export purposes.

datacard &lt;datc.o> adopts dividend rights plan
  datacard corp said it adopted a
  dividend rights plan in response to deluxe check printers inc
  &lt;dlx> having agreed to sell its 38 pct interest in datacard to
  national computer systems inc &lt;nlcs.o>.
datacard declared a dividend distribution of one preferred
  stock purchase right on each outstanding share its common
  stock.
the dividend is designed to deter national computer or
  other potential suitors from preventing datacard from
  evaluating all alternatives to maximize shareholder value,
  datacard said.
national computer told reuters june 22 it could make a bid
  for datacard.
on june 25 datacard filed suit in hennepin county
  district court in minnesota to block the sale of the 38 pct
  stake of its stock to national computer.
in announcing the rights plan, datacard said it "is not
  designed to deter takeovers that would be consistent with the
  objective of maximizing stockholders value to all of datacard's
  stockholders."
the rights will not become exercisable until 10 days after
  an announcement that a person or group has acquired beneficial
  ownership of 44 pct or more of datacard's common stock.
once exercisable, each right would entitle a holder to buy
  1/500th of a share of datacard series a junior participation
  preferred stock for 35 dlrs.
holders other than an acquirer
  would be entitled to purchase, for six-months after the right
  becomes exercisable, a number of shares of the new preferred
  stock with a market value equal to twice the exercise price of
  the rights.
the rights dividend distribution is payable july 9 to
  shareholders of record july 9.

entertainment &lt;em> may seek crazy eddie &lt;crzy>
  enetertainment marketing inc and its
  president elias zinn have demanded a list of crazy eddie inc
  shareholders from the company and said they may pursue a merger
  of the edison, n.j. electronics retailer.
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission,
  zinn said the demand for the shareholder list was made on june
  26 because he may desire to communicate with other crazy eddie
  shareholders "regarding the affairs" of the company.
zinn and his firm, which disclosed they hold a 5.1 pct
  stake in crazy eddie common stock, said they may acquire more
  shares through a negotiated merger or tender offer.
entertainment marketing was informed on june 25 by shearson
  lehman brothers inc., acting on behalf of crazy eddie, that it
  would be provided with "certain information" about crazy eddie,
  it told the sec.
entertainment marketing, a houston-based firm involved in
  electronics wholesaling and televised home shopping sales,
  proposed an eight dlr a share merger acquisition of crazy eddie
  on may 29, and modified the proposal on june 9 to include the
  possible participation of crazy eddie management.
entertainment marketing told the sec it expects to meet
  with crazy eddie representatives in the near future.
entertainment marketing also disclosed that it retained
  drexel burnham lambert inc as its financial advisor and
  investment banker.
in light of a june 17 announcement from crazy eddie that
  chemical bank would no longer fund a 52 mln dlr credit facility
  with the company, plus further declines in the price of its
  stock, entertainment marketing and zinn said they are
  "continuing to evaluate their alternatives with respect to
  their investment" in crazy eddie stock.
depending on its evaluation of the company, including
  actions by crazy eddie's board and any possible third party
  bids for the company, entertainment marketing and its president
  said they may hold their present stake in the company, sell
  some of their shares, or purchase more shares on the open
  market, through private purchases or in connection with a
  merger or tender offer.
according to the sec filing, entertainment marketing and
  zinn bought their current holdings of 1,560,000 crazy eddie
  common shares between may 20 and june 17 at 7.42 dlrs to 7.93
  dlrs a share, or a total of about 11.9 mln dlrs.
chances of direct u.s.-iran gulf clash seen low
  u.s. moves to increase its warships in
  and around the mideast gulf could trigger more attacks on
  unprotected merchant ships but run little risk of sparking a
  direct military clash with iran, diplomats said.
they said the american decision inevitably carries some
  risk of armed confrontation, but iran -- despite its blunt
  rhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as washington.
"as iran knows very well, what america is bringing into the
  gulf could do serious damage," said one western diplomat.
diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attacks
  on "soft targets" such as merchant shipping not protected by
  american or other western navy vessels patrolling the gulf.
the risk of iranian attack on u.s.
warships or kuwaiti oil
  tankers carrying the u.s.
flag and under naval escort is rated
  by diplomats as low.
however, "there is the threat that the
  iranians, seeing these heavily protected u.s.-flag tankers,
  will go for softer targets," one diplomat said.
tehran radio quoted iran's top defence spokesman ali akbar
  hashemi rafsanjani as saying yesterday that washington was
  "moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us."
the u.s. is increasing its gulf fleet from seven to 10
  warships and sending the refurbished battleship missouri to
  patrol just outside the strait of hormuz.
the build-up ties in with u.s. plans to start escorting
  kuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registered
  to fly the american flag to give them naval protection.
shipping serving kuwait has come under repeated attack by
  iran, angered at the emirate's war backing of iraq.
concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed by
  chinese-made silkworm missiles, which the u.s. says iran is
  preparing to deploy near the strait of hormuz.
the missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely to
  make iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said.
a military source in the gulf has said iran also set up a
  launching site for the silkworms on captured iraqi soil in the
  faw peninsula, within range of kuwait.
"but anything that went as far as a direct attack on kuwaiti
  territory would be a very serious escalation" likely moving
  world opinion against iran, remarked one.
some diplomats believe iran could also consider carrying
  out reprisals against the united states outside the gulf.
rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predicted
  last friday "a river of blood" throughout the world in the event
  of any u.s. strike against iran.
western diplomats said iran, which washington has accused
  of being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrable
  capacity to carry out attacks in the u.s. itself.
diplomats saw few potential targets in lebanon now that
  most americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked to
  pro-iranian groups.
but europe and asia were potential
  trouble-spots, and kuwait was one of the most obvious targets.
any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage or
  other action to make it difficult to blame iran, they added.

of the total, 2,059,400 shares are held by gamco

rains help u.s. western corn belt, more seen
  weekend rain over the western corn belt
  brought further relief to crop areas that had been dry earlier
  this month, and developing weather patterns will bring welcome
  moisture to central and eastern belt locations this week,
  according to dale mohler, senior meteorologist for accu-weather
  inc.
      "there is going to be more rain for the next two, three
  days," he said.
"we're in a fairly wet pattern with normal to
  above normal moisture this week."
mohler said rainfall averaged 1/2 inch across southern
  minnesota, 3/4 inch over southwest iowa, one inch in eastern
  nebraska and 1-1/2 inches in south-central nebraska.
illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend but
  were receiving scattered thundershower activity today, he said.
rain patterns will move across indiana to ohio with
  thudershower activity yielding to more general rains, he said.
"tomorrow, that eastern area will get 1/4 to one inch, a
  pretty good rain," mohler said.
rain was heavier than expected over the weekend, sparking
  an early selloff in soybean futures at the chicago board of
  trade.
prices were off 14 to 20-1/2 cents with november off
  19-1/2 cents at 5.43-1/2 dlrs.
mohler said the cold front now over the eastern belt is
  expected to move over the central midwest, then move north
  later in the week.
that could bring new rain patterns across
  the corn belt and assure good crop conditions as
  early-developed corn moves into the crucial pollination stage
  in early july, he said.

fed allows citicorp &lt;cci>, sears &lt;s> thrift deal
  the federal reserve board said it
  approved citicorp's application to purchase through its
  subsidiary, citicorp savings of oakland, calif., some assets
  and assume some liabilities of sears savings bank of glendale,
  calif.
      citicorp savings proposed to assume two billion dlrs in
  deposits and other liabilities and to purchase 1.9 billion dlrs
  in assets of 50 branch offices of sears savings.
the proposal involved less than one third of the assets and
  liabilities of sears savings, owned by sears, roebuck and co
  &lt;s>.
the fed said that it generally has determined there were
  potentially adverse effects of allowing affiliations of banks
  and savings and loan associations, although it has allowed bank
  holding companies to acquire some failing thrifts.
it said citicorp's proposal "properly may be viewed as the
  permissible acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of s
  and l branches rather than the acquisition of an s and l."
      citicorp savings, the successor to the failed fidelity
  savings and loan association, has assets of 4.9 billion dlrs
  and operates 86 branches in california, mainly in the north.
sears savings has 6.6 billion in assets and 91 branches
  predominantly in southern california.
the application, which was approved unanimously, will not
  eliminate sears savings as a competitor, the fed said.

group may support cardis corp &lt;cds> buyout
  a group of companies controlled by
  brookehill partners inc told government authorities it may
  support a buyout of cardis corp as a way to maximize the value
  of the company's stock.
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission, 
  the group disclosed that it currently holds a 5.5 pct stake in
  cardis common stock, and said it "would likely support" an
  acquisition of the company as a whole or in parts by another
  party, terming such a move "the most likely means for the
  company's shareholders to maximize the value of their
  investment."
although the group characterized its cardis stock holdings
  as principally for investment, it said it intends to contact
  third parties who might be interested in an acquisition of
  cardis, a los angeles-based auto parts distributor.
the group added its has already had "some contacts" with
  others concerning the company, but said no understandings have
  been reached.
"the (cardis) common shares continue to offer opportunity
  for price appreciation on the basis of the company's asset
  value and earnings momentum," the brookehill group told the
  sec.
the group, which currently holds 318,900 cardis common
  shares, consists of new york-based brookehill partners and its
  two subsidiaries, brookehill equities inc, a brokerage, and
  moore, grossman and derose inc, an investment advisor.
walter
  grossmman, s. edward moore and robert derose, all of new york,
  each own one-third interests in brookehill partners.
since april 27, members of the brookehill group made net
  purchases of 6,000 cardis common shares at approximately 4 dlrs
  a share.
the group told the sec it may continue to purchase
  additional cardis stock, but also reserved the right to sell
  its shares in the company.

  should try to pass legislation to prohibit it.
wright, a texas democrat, told reporters the administration
  had gone ahead with plans to reflag the kuwaiti tankers as u.s.
  ships without asking congressional leaders for their advice.

sec says campeau unit violated disclosure rules
  the securities and exchange
  commission charged allied stores corp with failing to promptly
  disclose key steps it was taking last september to thwart a
  takeover attempt by campeau corp.
in an administrative complaint, the sec said allied and its
  legal adviser failed to promptly inform shareholders and the
  agency that it had begun talks with youngstown, ohio, shopping
  center developer edward debartolo in response to campeau's
  takeover offer.
campeau acquired allied for an estimated 4.2 billion dlrs
  on jan 1, following a battle with debartolo.
on sept 25, a day after allied disclosed that its board had
  urged rejection of campeau's sept 12 tender offer for 58 dlrs a
  share, allied began negotiating the sale of six shopping
  centers to debartolo, the sec said.
allied legal advisor and director george kern, who heads
  the merger and acquisitions group at the new york law firm of
  sullivan and cromwell, decided against amending allied's sec
  filing to disclose the talks even though they had resulted in
  sales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers, it said.
securities law requires takeover target companies to
  promptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets.
the day after campeau increased its tender offer to 80 pct
  of allied's stock from 55 pct and raised its bid to 66 dlrs a
  share from 58 dlrs on sept 29, allied and a partnership headed
  by debartolo began negotiating a takeover deal aimed at
  thwarting campeau, the sec said.
kern again decided against disclosing the talks in an
  amended sec filing, the agency charged.
allied's first disclosure of the debartolo takeover was
  made on oct 8, even though its board approved the merger on oct
  3 and the merger agreement was executed on oct 7, the complaint
  said.
debartolo and campeau later engaged in a bitter battle for
  control of allied, with campeau winning out later in october
  when it bought a block of 25.8 mln shares of allied stock, or
  48 pct of the total, in a controversial move made only minutes
  after it dropped its hostile tender offer.
the acquisition of the additional 48 pct, which a federal
  judge allowed to be completed, gave campeau a majority stake in
  allied.
campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share.
the sec said it had planned to file a court brief joining
  with allied in charging that campeau had engaged in an illegal
  tender offer.
but the sec brief was never filed since the case was
  dropped following an agreement between campeau and debartolo.
in the administrative proceeding against allied and kern,
  the sec is asking for an administrative order that they comply
  with reporting provisions of securities laws in the future.
although allied is no longer publicly traded since it
  became a subsidiary of campeau, it still files annual and
  quarterly reports to the sec because it has outstanding debt.

u.s. to end netherlands antilles tax treaty
  the treasury department said it
  notified the netherlands that it was terminating the 1948
  income tax treaty as it applies to the netherlands antilles and
  aruba.
the termination is effective january 1, 1988, the treasury
  said in a two-sentence announcement.
the treasury decided to end the treaty after negotiations
  between the united states and the netherlands over the past
  eight years had failed to reach an accord, a treasury spokesman
  said.
the decision means the sale by u.s. parent companies of
  eurobonds through netherlands antilles subsidiaries will no
  longer be free of the 30 pct u.s. withholding tax, the
  spokesman said.
terminating the tax treaty with the netherlands antilles 
  may cause bond issuers to call in the bonds early.
most have
  maturities of 10 years or less and were issued before 1984, the
  spokesman said.
he said the treasury did not expect the action to have an
  adverse effect on u.s. issuers of the bonds because the general
  decline in interest rates means they will be able to refinance
  at lower interest rates.
however, the holders of the bonds presumably will be faced
  with lower yields.

cipec studying copper market backwardation
  the paris-based intergovernmental council
  of copper exporting countries (cipec) is closely studying the
  current backwardation in world copper market prices but does
  not envisage taking corrective action at present, cipec sources
  here said.
the organisation's executive and marketing committees
  reviewed the current market situation during a series of
  meetings here late last week, but took no major decisions.
the sources noted that the backwardation - premium of
  nearby supply over forward delivery - dates back several weeks
  and is the longest on record.
"it's unusual," one official said, but added cipec did not
  have any immediate recipe to remedy the situation.
the meetings featured a gathering of the 10 directors of
  cipec's regional copper development and promotion centres,
  which are based in europe, japan, india and brazil.
their main aim was to prepare the ground for the annual
  ministerial meeting of cipec, which is scheduled for zaire in
  late september.
the last three ministerial meetings have been held in paris
  to keep down costs.

dauster says consumers should keep out of quotas
  consumer countries should not
  intervene in the distribution of coffee export quotas,
  brazilian coffee institute president jorio dauster said.
"distribution of export quotas should be in the hands of
  producers as has been traditional," dauster, a delegate at the
  recent coffee symposium here, told journalists.
"when consumers
  want to get involved, talks are much more difficult."
the main consumer country the united states and main
  producer brazil failed to reach agreement on quota distribution
  when the international coffee organisation (ico) met in
  february.
dauster said brazil's role when the ico meets in london in
  september will be to support the world coffee pact, defend its
  market share and argue for distribution of quotas to be in the
  hands of producer countries.
"we have sacrificed a great deal already," he said.
"this year
  we have a crop of 35 mln bags, we have economic problems and we
  are not in a position to do favours."

san francisco, not region, hurt by restructuring
  corporate mergers and acquisitions
  in and around san francisco over the past seven years have had
  only a modest effect on the metropolitan area's economy, a
  leading business-backed organization said.
the bay area council, a group of more than 300 business
  firms, said that a study of corporate restructuring in a
  nine-county area found that san francisco itself had suffered
  some ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surrounding
  communities had not.
seventeen of the 32 fortune 500 companies in the area left
  due to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986, but
  another 21 firms were added to the list.
ten of the departing companies were based in san francisco.
during the period, only six located in the city achieved
  fortune 500 status.
ted hall, a council director and local managing director of
  mckinsey and co. which conducted the survey, said the study
  grew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriously
  hurt the economic climate of northern california.
however, hall said that only about 36,000 jobs had been
  lost in the region, while more than 600,000 new jobs were
  created during the period.
at the same time, he said, the region experienced a greater
  rise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the rest
  of the united states and california.
council president george keller, who also is chairman and
  chief executive officer of chevron corp., told a news
  conference that the region had difficulties in persuading
  companies to locate there because of a fragmented local
  political system.
but he said that because of the amenities of living in san
  francisco, he was the envy of many chief executives in other
  metropolitan area.
"it's a great place to run a business," he added, "but it's
  a hell of a place to do business with government."
the study concluded that chevron, which mergered with gulf
  oil in 1984, would benefit in the long run from the
  restructuring activity.
among the corporate headquarters lost during the period
  were crown zellerbach, memorex, southern pacific, castle &amp;
  cooke and rolm.
companies that grew enough during the period to make the
  fortune 500 list included apple computer, pacific telesis,
  mckesson, tandem computer, u.s. leasing and amfac.
the study by the management consulting firm said that,
  partly due to corporate restructuring, the rate of job growth
  in san francisco has slowed since 1980.
in addition, it said that the loss of corporate leadership
  had adversely affected some of the bay area's civic and
  charitable activities.

  and co told reuters.
he said industry estimates put the total reserves at the
  field at over one billion barrels, but given the low gravity of
  oil, the recovery rate would be expected to be around 20-25
  pct.
analysts said the results were encouraging, but the
  potential difficulty of operating and recovering oil in the
  field was shown by the fact that the first well had to be
  plugged and a sidetrack drilled.
"the field seems to be shallow and widespread, which will
  require a multi-platform development in recovery, pushing costs
  up," christopher osborne of stockbroker hoare govett said.
most analysts said that although the low gravity of the oil
  found would require additional costs in recovery, the test well
  showed that it flows well.
"although the gravity of oil at the field seems to be low,
  it seems to flow quite well and around 300 mln barrels could be
  recovered," carol bell of phillips and drew told reuters.
however, chevron officials declined to comment on the
  analysts' reserve estimates.
they said that without further
  research and drilling in the area this summer, they would not
  disclose any reserve figures.
analysts said that if the field were declared commercial
  and developed, there would be a ready local market for the
  heavy crude it produced.
"most refineries are now upgraded to refine heavy oils and
  the price differentials between heavy and light crudes are a
  lot narrower today," osborne said.
chevron operates the block on behalf of 16 companies which
  include british petroleum development ltd, dsm hydrocarbons
  (uk) ltd, enterprise oil (tns) ltd, marathon int.
pet.
(gb) ltd
  and phillips petroleum co u.k. ltd.

pakistan allows private cotton, rice exports
  the pakistani government allowed the
  private sector to export cotton and rice in a new trade policy
  announced to cover the next three years.
commerce and planning minister mahbubul haq said in a
  televised speech it was also decided to allow duty-free import
  of cotton yarn.
cotton and rice are pakistan's main exports, which have
  been handled exclusively by state corporations since early
  1970s.
haq said now the private sector would export cotton and
  rice along with the state corporations.
he said duty-free import of cotton yarn was allowed to make
  high quality yarn available to local ancillary industries and
  to enable them to compete effectively in the world market.
this
  would help overcome domestic shortages of yarn, he said.

ecuador to produce above opec quota - minister
  ecuador will produce crude oil in excess
  of its 221,000-bpd opec quota during the second half of this
  year, energy minister fernando santos alvite told a news
  conference.
ecuador plans to produce 280,000 bpd in august, rising to
  320,000 bpd next january, the minister said.
"we will be producing more than the quota to pay off the
  crude and products we have been lent by venezuela, nigeria and
  kuwait and to compensate for the crude we have been unable to
  produce during the past few months," he said.
earthquake damage to a pipeline sharply cut ecuadorean
  production from march to may this year.
santos said the move had been explained to fellow opec
  members during last week's meeting in vienna, when an increase
  in ecuador's quota to 221,000 bpd from 210,000 was approved.
"they understood our position and we believe we remain
  within the spirit of the (quota) agreement," he said.
immediately before the march quake ecuadorean production
  was 250,000-260,000 bpd, with 144,000 bpd exported.
while its production was down, venezuela, nigeria and
  kuwait loaned ecuador a total 12 mln barrels of crude and four
  mln barrels of products, santos said.

franco-german parley fails to unblock farm talks
  a specially convened franco-german
  meeting in the sidelines of a summit of ec leaders failed to
  make any progress over a 1987-88 farm price package that has
  deeply split the two former ec allies, diplomats said
      the meeting was attended by farm ministers and foreign
  ministers from both countries and by french president francois
  mitterand, his prime minister jacques chirac, and by chancellor
  helmut kohl of west germany.
the stalemate over farm prices is seen as a key to
  providing a solution to a long-term settlement of the
  community's worst-ever budget crisis.
"the germans clearly do not want to budge," an aide to chirac
  told reporters.
he added the french prime minister was visibly
  angered as he the hour-long meeting.
bonn and paris are diametrically opposed to a proposal for
  the brussels executive commission to overhaul radically the
  ec's complex "green" currrency system, designed to translate
  common ec farm prices into national currencies.
paris also supports a move for an oils and fats tax which
  west germany is against, along with britain, denmark and the
  netherlands.
ec farm minsters are due to resume negotiations on the
  package, which should have been agreed by an april 1 deadline
  tomorrow.
diplomats said it had been hoped that the summit could have
  injected fresh impetus into those talks.
the commission proposed its package to save one billion
  dollars on the ec's ever-rising farm budget.
the summit has been dominated by lengthy talks on moves to
  alter the entire system of financing the 12-nation group, and
  plugging a 5.7 billion dollar budget shortfall for 1987.
venezuela lowers exchange rate for oil earnings
  venezuela's cabinet approved a new
  exchange rate for oil and mining export earnings, setting it at
  14.50 bolivars to the dollar from 7.50 bolivars previously,
  minister manuel azpur ua said.
azpur told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the
  measure is "fundamental to conserving the economic and financial
  strength of the petroleum industry."
he said the new exchange rate, which goes before the
  central bank for final approval tommorrow, will allow the state
  oil company petroleos de venezuela, s.a.(pdvsa) to solve its
  problem of working capital and implement investment plans,
  estimated at 20 billion bolivars for 1987.
he did not say when
  the measure would become effective.
venezuela's oil industry previously sold its dollar earnings
  to the government at 7.50 to the dollar but bought foreign
  exchange from its imports at 14.50 bolivars.
the new exchange rate will promote purchases of domestic
  goods and services by the industry, azpur said.
he added that
  it would also put pdvsa in a position to purchase more
  government debt bonds.
pdvsa had available liquid assets of 20 billion bolivars at
  the start of this year, of which nine billion were in a trust
  fund in the central bank of venezuela (bcv) and placed in
  government bonds.
according to a contract between pdvsa and the central bank,
  the bcv must provide cash as the oil industry requries by
  repurchasing the bonds.
pdvsa's contribution to the treasury last year was 44.480
  billion bolivars.
it foreign earnings for oil and petrochemcial
  sales were 8.023 billion dlrs.

interest rates hurt u.s. may housing sales
  sales of new single-family homes
  tumbled 14.9 pct in may from april levels because of higher
  mortgage interest rates, analysts said.
"there should be another month or two of very weak new home
  sales but with interest rates stabilizing, sale of new homes
  should become more stable by mid-summer," said economist
  lawrence chimerine of wharton econometrics inc.
the drop in may, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
  616,000 units, was the largest since january 1982, the commerce
  department said.
interest rates on conventional mortgages bottomed out at
  about 9.08 pct in march and rose to about 10.7 pct in april,
  according to stephen roach, economist at morgan stanley.
the effect was to freeze some potential new homebuyers out
  of the market, he and others said.
"the rates moved very suddenly and were certainly
  unexpected by homebuyers," said cynthia latta, an economist
  with data resources.
"they were so startled, they wanted to
  hold back and see what would happen."
the drop in sales of new single-family home sales was
  sharper than expected, some economists said.
"we fully expected
  a decline but the extent was more than we anticipated," said
  james christian, chief economist for the u.s. league of savings
  institutions.
christian said there was a sharp rise in may in sales of
  existing homes, which are generally less expensive than new
  homes.
latta of data resources said strong sales of new
  condominiums in the northeast and on the west coast were
  reflected in sales of existing but not new homes.
christian of the u.s. league of savings institutions said,
  "underlying housing demand remains strong.
i think the market
  is going to stabilize and give us a good second half."
others were less optimistic, however.
"we clearly won't have a boom (in new home sales) but i
  don't think this is the start of a collapse in single-family
  housing," said chimerine of wharton.
eugene sherman, chief economist of the federal home loan
  bank of new york, said, "the lower sales level will be
  maintained for awhile until there is another change in rates.
there won't be much specific improvement in coming months."
bass group has stake in bell and howell &lt;bhw>
  an investor group led by robert bass

  common stock outstanding.
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission,
  the group said it purchased 511,500 bell and howell common
  shares between april 29 and june 26 at 44.25 dlrs to 56.02 dlrs
  a share.
the stock was acquired for investment purposes, the group
  said, adding it may purchase or sell additional shares in the
  future.
u.s. reasserts plans for deterrent role in gulf
  the united states responded to an
  apparent escalation of iranian rhetoric with continued
  assurances that its expanded military force in the gulf would
  play purely a deterrent role.
"i can only emphasize that our role there is deterrent, that
  we're going to be assuring safety for american shipping and
  that that shipping is not related to the war itself," state
  department spokesman charles redman told reporters.
he was asked about iranian claims that the united states
  was moving towards the brink of armed conflict with iran.
tehran radio quoted defence spokesman ali akbar hashemi
  rafsanjani telling a visiting nicaraguan delegation yesterday,
  "at the moment the united states is moving towards the brink of
  an armed encounter with us.
"we are not concerned about this and believe that the u.s.
presence in the war will make our nation even more serious.
we
  are determined to stand firm and will certainly win."
the united states disclosed last week it was beefing up its
  gulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and also sending the
  refurbished battleship missouri to patrol just outside the
  strategic strait of hormuz, entrance to the gulf.
the buildup ties in with u.s. plans to escort kuwaiti oil
  tankers which have been re-registered to fly the american flag
  and gain naval protection against iranian attacks.
asked about the iranian rhetoric, white house spokesman
  marlin fitzwater said, "we won't have any comment or response to
  the iranian statements.
our position has been made clear about
  the status of events in the gulf.
we want an end to the war
  with no winners and no losers and any activities or statements
  that tend to prolong the war or increase hostilities are not
  helpful or welcome."
redman said he could not independently confirm reports that
  iran has offered to halt attacks on gulf shipping.

israel minister sees increased exports to u.s.
  israel's exports to the u.s. can and
  must double over the next five years if the mideast nation's
  goal of economic independence is to be achieved, said gad
  yaacobi, israeli minister of economy and communication.
speaking before an american-israel chamber of commerce
  seminar, yaacobi said that in 1986 israeli exports to the u.s.
  were over 2.3 billion dlrs or about one-third of israel's total
  exports, while imports from the u.s. were around 1.8 billion
  dlrs or roughly one-sixth of the total.
"i am convinced that israel exports to the u.s. can reach
  five billion dlrs in the next five years, if we learn to
  function in the american marketplace and place greater emphasis
  on product quality," yaacobi said.
while the weakening of the dollar vis-a-vis european
  currencies is a "bottleneck to increasing exports to the u.s.,"
  yaacobi said he expects israel to extend its recent trend
  toward higher u.s. exports.
in the last ten years, israeli exports to the u.s. rose
  fivefold, from 417 mln dlrs to 2.3 billion in 1986, while
  imports rose from 888 mln dlrs to 1.8 billion last year.
yaacobi said export growth must increase ten to eleven pct
  annually, the rate achieved until the 1973 yom kippur war.
he said that the u.s./israel free trade agreement, passed
  last year and eliminating all duties and other commercial
  restrictions between the two nations through 1994, would
  continue to facilitate the desired export growth.
dual agreements included in the fta allow israel to act as
  an economic bridge between the u.s. and europe, enabling u.s.
  firms to export to europe at lower cost if a certain percentage
  of the exported is produced in israel, and vice-versa.
yaacobi said that tensions among the nations of the middle
  east was one of the main reasons israel had not yet been able
  to achieve its economic potential.
since 1973 the u.s. has given israel 25 billion dlrs in
  aid, but most of it went to defense expenditures and financing
  military conflicts "which were imposed on israel," he said.
short of achieving israel's full growth potential, however,
  yaccobi said it would still be possible to achieve economic
  independence by 1993 or 1994, based on the assumption that
  exports can be doubled from 1986 levels in that time period.

venezuela budget sees 16.35 dlrs oil price
  venezuela's government tomorrow presents
  a 1988 budget proposal for 183.432 billion bolivars, based upon
  an oil price of 16.35 dlrs per barrel, finance minister manuel
  azpurua said.
azpurua told reporters after a cabinet meeting the new
  budget projects ordinary income of 149.925 billion bolivars and
  extraordinary income of 34.186 billion.
oil revenues are
  expected to produce 92.014 billion, or 61 pct of the total.
the finance minister said the oil revenue projection is
  based on an average price of 16.35 dlrs per barrel in 1988.
venezuelan oil through the first half of 1987 has averaged 16.
20 dlrs per barrel, according to the state oil company
  petroleos de venezuela, s.a.
gencorp &lt;gy> to sell general tire
  gencorp inc and continental ag of
  hanover, west germany, jointy announced they signed an
  agreement for continental to buy gencorp's general tire inc
  subsidiary for 650 mln dlrs in cash.
under the agreement the companies said continental will
  acquire general tire, including its related domestic and
  foreign operations, and gencorp will retain liability for the
  medical benefits of retired general tire employees who retired
  on or before november 30, 1984.
the sale is expected to be completed on or before november
  one and is subject to meeting certain conditions.
continental is europe's second largest tire producer.
last
  year, the company had sales of 2.6 billion dlrs, with 1.9
  billion dlrs generated by its tire operations.
last year, general tire had operating profits of 79 mln
  dlrs on sales of 1.1 billion dlrs, and gencorp had operating
  profits of 130 mln dlrs on sales of 3.1 billion dlrs.
gencorp spokesman rip tilden said the company will retain
  about 100 mln dlrs in liability for its former general tire
  employees under the agreement.
tilden said gencorp will use the proceeds from the sale to
  reduce its 1.5 billion dlr debt.
in april, gencorp sucessfully thwarted a takeover by a
  partnership formed by afg industries inc &lt;afg> and wagner and
  brown with a restructuring program that included the purchase
  of up to 54 pct, or 12.5 mln shares, of its common at 130 dlrs
  a share for a total of 1.6 billion dlrs
      as part of the restructuring, gencorp also said it planned
  to sell its tire business, the bottling operations of its rko
  general inc subsidiary, and rko's remaining broadcast
  properties to focus on the company's aerospace and automotive

tilden said gencorp expects to realize about 850 mln dlrs
  in after tax proceeds by the end of 1987 as a result of sale of
  several pieces of the nonbroadcast assets of the company,
  including general tire.
"the price paid for general tire would not cause us to
  reevaluate that estimate," said tilden.
general tire employs 10,000 people worldwide and has four
  tire manufacturing plants in the u.s. and one in canada.
in a statemnet, a. william reynolds, gencorp chairman said
  the sale of general tire "represents a critical accomplishment
  in our plan to restructure gencorp."
reynolds also said gencorp's previously announced sale of
  its other businesses are "proceeding satisfactorily."
among the pieces of gencorp's empire that remain to be sold
  are its rko bottling operations.
gencorp agreed to sell rko's
  khj-tv station to walt disney co &lt;dis> for
  217 mln dlrs.
that deal awaits approval by the federal
  communications commission.
gencorp also received 257 dlrs after
  tax from the sale of rko's wor-tv.

  digital communications

  to buy its fox research inc unit for a cash payment and the
  assumption of liabilities of around 10 mln dlrs.
the company said part of the agreement includes payment of
  up to an additional 6.5 mln dlrs based on the performance of
  the unit in the year following the closing.
the company said the deal is expected to be closed in
  mid-august.
fox research develops, makes and markets local area

a.h. robins &lt;qrah> to consider rorer offer
  a.h. robins co said its board
  has concluded that the merger proposal submitted by rorer group
  inc &lt;ror> merits further consideration.
at the request of the board, rorer has agreed to extend
  until 1800 edt july 2 its deadline for response from a.h.
  robins.
after rorer announced its second bid for the company last
  thursday, analysts forecast that the robins family, which holds
  control of the company, would vigourously oppose any merger.
but, the analysts added, that robins desire to emerge
  independent from two years of bankruptcy proceedings may be
  thwarted by some robins' shareholders who perceive a merger as
  a more expedient way of dealing with the company's dalkon
  shield related liabilities.
after a failed first attempt earlier this year, rorer's
  latest merger plan calls for a share swap worth about 720 mln
  dlrs.
rorer would also set up two trusts to cover the estimated
  1.75 billion dlrs in liabilities to deal with about 320,000
  claims by women who suffered maladies from the use of the
  dalkon shield interuterine device.
pakistan unveils new trade policy to boost exports
  pakistani government allowed freer
  cotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimed
  at narrowing the country's yawning trade gap.
commerce and planning minister mahbubul haq said in a
  televised speech the government had also decided to allow
  duty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industry
  more competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export of
  pakistani products.
cotton and rice are pakistan's main exports, which have
  been handled exclusively by state corporations since early
  1970s.
but haq said now the private sector would also export
  cotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets a
  long-standing demand of the local traders.
the duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed to
  bring down prices and help the local ancillary industries
  compete effectively in the world market, he said.
haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year
  1987/88 beginning on july 1, would be for three years but
  reviewed every year.
it was a departure from the previous practice of announcing
  trade policies for a single fiscal year, and haq said it would
  enable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over a
  longer period.
he said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been provided
  for the export of engineering goods to selected third world
  countries on soft credit terms.
pakistan's 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 per
  cent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23
  billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86.
he said the government policy was to rationalise and
  streamline import controls.
"it has been observed that due to restrictions on imports,
  specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, local
  industry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs," he
  said.
"prices have been on the increase and quality of goods
  produced has been low.
this restrictive policy also gave rise
  to smuggling and hampering of exports."
he said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freed
  from import restrictions.
previously, pakistan has met its trade gap largely from
  remittances from its nationals working abroad, mainly in the
  gulf.
however, the remittances have begun to fall after the
  drop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of a
  balance of payments crisis for pakistan.
citicorp &lt;cci> savings extends california reach
  citicorp has extended its reach
  into the california market with citicorp savings' acquisition
  of 50 of sears roebuck's &lt;s> sears savings bank branches,
  bringing its presences to 143 branches in 101 communities,
  citicorp savings said.
thrift industry analysts said the move, approved by the
  federal reserve board today, is a plus for citicorp and shows
  its serious intent to penetrate the california market.
the acquisition mostly extends citicorp's reach into
  southern california, where 34 of the 50 branches are located.
citicorp savings was predominantly in northern california.
"this marks our first major expansion in california,
  particularly in the south," said citicorp savings president
  edward valencia, in a statement.
thrift industry sources said they do not see a major
  near-term impact on the southern california thrift market, but
  do expect citicorp to be a more aggressive competitor than
  sears was in that market.
"we do believe they will be a better competitor than
  sears," said james stutz, executive vice president of home
  federal savings and loan association &lt;hfd>, based in san diego.
banking industry sources said the move is viewed as
  groundwork, to establish citicorp throughout the california
  market, well before the 1991 law change that will allow it to
  operate as a bank in the state.
they said citicorp is likely to
  convert the branches to banks at that time.
in the near-term, however, analysts said with seven billion
  dlrs in assets, citicorp savings is still not a major force in
  the thrift market, against such large california thrifts as
  home federal, great western financial corp &lt;gwf>, h f ahmanson
  and co &lt;ahm>, golden west  financial &lt;gwd> and great american
  first savings bank &lt;gta>.
contel &lt;ctc> unit sales seen by analysts
  contel corp's telecommunications
  equipment unit is the most likely candidate for sale by the
  atlanta-based telecommunications company, wall street analysts
  said.
"executone is at the top of the list," said one analyst,
  referring to contel's loss-riden telecommunications equipment
  unit.
"the question is, who would take it?"
he added.
the company, forecasting a 15 pct drop in 1987 operating
  earnings over last year, said late today that it is reviewing
  all operations in an effort aimed at "maximizing long-term
  stockholder value."
analysts also said contel's federal systems division, which
  has been hit with several executive defections, may also be put
  on the block.
contel officials declined to comment on the possibility of
  selling any operations.
however, the company indicated in a
  statement that it was closely evaluating the telecommunications
  and federal systems units.

u.s./soviet grain meeting unlikely this summer
  prospects appear slim for a summer
  meeting between u.s. and soviet officials before the two
  countries enter the final year of their bilateral grains
  agreement, agriculture department officials said.
the two sides usually try to meet as each new year of the
  agreeement approaches although the last meeting was delayed up
  to last february.
however, any delay this year should not
  endanger the fifth year of the grains agreement that extends
  through september, 1988, usda officials said.
"it will be difficult to pull together the people for the
  meeting during july," an aide to usda undersecretary daniel
  amstutz said.
since the last meeting was only around four months ago, the
  next talks could still be a "couple more months," he said.
there has been grain industry speculation that the usda
  will offer moscow another wheat subsidy during the next
  marketing year.
but usda officials said even if consultations
  were held soon a subsidy offer would probably not be made.
"i doubt that there would be any subsidy offer this summer
  or before the next agreement year begins," a usda source said.
citing limited subsidy funds and uncertainties about next
  year's crops, he said, "there are too many variables now.
it
  would be uncharacteristic of us to make an offer now."
under the nonbinding pact, moscow has agreed to purchase a
  minimum of nine mln tonnes of u.s. grain per year.
soviet and
  u.s. officials normally meet in the summer before the start of
  a new agreement year to discuss grain quality, shipping
  logistics and production outlooks.

justice opposes quick greyhound-trailways merger
  the justice department said it asked
  the government to proceed cautiously on a plan allowing the
  nation's two largest intercity bus companies to merge their
  operations, a move one of the firms said may derail the deal.
justice's opposition to quick federal approval of a bid by
  greyhound lines inc to take immediate control trailways corp
  prompted greyhound to threaten -- in a brief filed with the
  interstate commerce commission (icc) -- to drop the merger
  plan.
greyhound officials told reuters late today the company
  hoped for icc action on the merger by tomorrow.
"greyhound lines will go forward with the transaction only
  if it is permitted to assume immediate, unconditional control
  of trailways' operations and to integrate them with its
  operations," greyhound said in a filing with the icc, the
  federal regulatory agency which has the final say over mergers
  of interstate bus companies.
but justice had said in an earlier filing with the icc that
  it wanted the agency to move slowly on the plan and to turn
  down greyhound's request to begin operating trailways
  immediately.
"the department has just begun to receive relevant
  information on trailways' financial condition and is in the
  process of assessing the correctness of the company's
  allegations," acting assistant attorney general charles rule
  said in comments submitted to the icc.
greyhound announced june 19 that it wanted the icc to let
  it begin operating trailways immediately while continuing to
  evaluate the merger for possible antitrust problems.
greyhound said it would pay 80 mln dlrs for many of
  trailways' terminals, buses and garages.
the two companies said in papers filed with the icc that
  trailways "could collapse in a matter of days."
they said trailways owed suppliers more than six mln dlrs,
  with another six mln dlrs due june 30.
the suppliers, they said, could force trailways into
  bankruptcy "at any time."
trailways also owes a consortium of banks 76 mln dlrs, and
  the consortium has threatened to call the loan if trailways
  fails to pay the interest due june 30, they said.

state to control 70 pct of pakistan tea imports
  pakistan announced a new tea import
  policy, saying 70 pct of imports will in future be made through
  the state trading corporation of pakistan (tcp).
commerce minister mahbubul haq said in a television
  broadcast that no more than one-third of the remaining 30 pct
  allocated to the private sector would be permitted to come from
  any one country.
the new policy was announced some three months after the
  government suspended import licences and ordered an inquiry
  into tea purchase policy.
traders said the move was designed to put pressure on kenya,
  which provided some 48 pct of pakistan's 75-80 mln kilo annual
  tea imports, to buy pakistani manufactured goods in exchange.
liptons and brooke bond, two units of britain's unilever
  plc, control 95 pct of pakistan's hard-pack tea market, traders
  said.
haq, who is also planning minister, was outlining a new
  three-year trade policy from the start of financial 1987/88 on
  july 1.

japan unemployment rises to record 3.2 pct in may
  japan's seasonally adjusted unemployment
  rate rose to a record 3.2 pct in may, the worst level since the
  government started compiling unemployment statistics in 1953,
  the government's management and coodination agency said.
the may rate surpassed the previous record of 3.0 pct
  marked set in january and april this year.
it was also up
  sharply from 2.7 pct a year earlier.
unadjusted may unemployment totalled 1.91 mln people, up
  from 1.90 mln in april and 1.62 mln a year earlier.
an agency official blamed industrial restructuring and the
  strong yen for the rise in unemployment.
the seasonally adjusted male unemployment rate in may rose
  to a record 3.2 pct, surpassing the previous record 3.0 pct set
  in july 1986.
this compares with 2.9 pct in april and 2.7 pct a
  year earlie.
unadjusted male unemployment totalled 1.12 mln, up
  180,000 from a year earlier.
the female unemployment rate in may was unchanged from
  april at a record 3.1 pct.
a year ago, the rate was 2.8 pct.
unadjusted female unemployment rose 100,000 to 790,000.

miyazawa says g-7 still supports louvre accord
  japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa
  said the group of seven (g-7) nations still support the louvre
  accord to stabilise currencies.
he also told a news conference following a cabinet meeting
  that the group of five (g-5) and g-7 do not have any plans to
  meet for talks.
the finance minister further said that overseas stock
  market plunges will not lead to a freefall in the tokyo stock
  market.
"there is no special worry about the stock market in
  tokyo," he added.
miyazawa said the tokyo stock market should not be gravely
  affected by the downturns of markets in new york and london
  because there is a clear sign of an economic recovery in japan
  and stability of exchange rates.
asked if the u.s. had contacted japan after the stock
  market plunge in new york, miyazawa said there was not any
  contact.

japan understands u.s.
attack on iran oil platform
  japan said it understood why the u.s.
attacked an iranian oil platform on monday.
"japan, deeply concerned over the increasing threat to the
  ships navigating in the gulf, understands the circumstances
  that have led the united states government to take these
  measures," the foreign ministry said in a statement.
the statement added that the threat to free and safe
  navigation had increased after the missile attack on a
  u.s.-flagged tanker in kuwaiti territorial waters last friday.
venezuela sees flat oil price despite u.s.
attack
  world oil prices would remain stable
  despite the u.s.
attack against iranian oil platforms and
  growing tension in the gulf, venezuelan energy minister arturo
  hernandez grisanti said on monday.
he described the situation as "extremely tense," but said
  gulf military activity would not significantly affect prices
  because supply and demand were roughly equal.
demand for opec crude in the final quarter of 1987 was 18.5
  mln barrels per day (bpd) and the group's members were now
  pumping above 18 mln bpd, he told a news conference.
hernandez grisanti said the supply/demand balance was
  precarious and prices were in danger of falling from their
  current average of about 18 dlrs per barrel if overproduction
  continued.
three or four members of the 13-nation organisation of
  petroleum exporting countries were "overproducing in an
  exaggerated manner" above their assigned quotas, he said.
opec's overall ceiling is 16.6 mln bpd.
if dollar follows wall street japanese will divest
  if the dollar goes the way of wall street,
  japanese will finally move out of dollar investments in a
  serious way, japan investment managers say.
the japanese, the dominant foreign investors in u.s. dollar
  securities, have already sold u.s. equities.
but "if the dollar falls steeply, which did not happen
  yesterday, japanese investors will definitely try to withdraw
  significant funds from u.s. shares," said akira kawakami, deputy
  manager of nomura investment trust and management co ltd's
  international investment department.
an unstable, lower dollar would also affect japanese
  investment in u.s. bonds.
"japan-u.s. interest rate
  differentials, which currently look wide enough, mean nothing
  in the absence of dollar stability," said kawakami.
u.s. bonds could benefit due to a gloomy economic picture
  following the estimated huge losses in stocks by major u.s.
  institutional and individual investors, he said.
the effect
  should be to rule out any u.s. interest rate rise.
but most japanese investors in u.s. bonds are still wiating
  to see if the dollar really is stable, he said.
the dollar was
  holding firm at above 142 yen on tuesday morning.
"although japanese investors sold huge amounts of stocks in
  new york yesterday, most are still looking for chances to
  lighten their u.s. stock inventories," hiromitsu sunada, manager
  of meiji mutual life insurance co's international investment
  department said.
their sales helped send wall street stocks down 508 points
  to 1,738, the market's biggest percentage drop since 1914.
"investment in u.s. stocks and bonds is difficult,
  considering the dangers," said katsuhiko okiyama, deputy general
  manager and chief adviser of yamaichi securities co ltd's fixed
  income securities marketing group.
japanese investment at home could start to pick up once
  markets have stopped reacting to wall street, the managers
  said.
the tokyo yen bond market is likely to stabilise in one
  or two weeks, which is what investors have been waiting for.
the bottom for yen bonds should be around a 6.3 pct yield for
  the 5.1 pct 89th bond, they said.
"the basic background which has supported the stocks and
  bonds markets has not changed," said norio okutsu, assistant
  general manager of nikko securities' bond department.
"but new
  outflows of funds to the u.s. will be decreasing."
however,
  this was already evident three months ago, he said.
asian cocoa producers expand despite critics
  asian cocoa producers are expanding
  output despite depressed world prices and they dismiss
  suggestions in the london market that their cocoa is inferior.
"leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their market
  from our product," said a spokesman for indonesia's directorate
  general of plantations.
"we're happy about our long-term future."
malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales in
  asia and the united states if malaysian cocoa was not suitable
  for european tastes.
they were responding to comments by london traders that
  large tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from malaysia, indonesia
  and papua new guinea (png) were helping to depress cocoa
  prices.
london traders said the asian cocoa was considered
  unsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and a
  high level of free fatty acids.
ng siew kee, the chairman of malaysia's cocoa growers'
  council, said malaysia should expand its sales to asia and the
  united states if it did not produce a type suitable for western
  europe.
a spokesman for the png cocoa industry board said the
  london market was mistaken if it linked png cocoa with
  high-acid malaysian and indonesian beans.
"when the market is declining, buyers seize on anything to
  talk down prices," the spokesman said.
he said that png could sell whatever cocoa it produces.
png exported 33,000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoa
  year ending september 30, of which nearly 50 pct was exported
  to west germany, 16 pct to the u.s. and the rest to the
  netherlands and britain.
the indonesia spokesman, an agriculture ministry official
  who wished not to be identified, said indonesia had no problem
  with quality and would continue to expand sales.
he described
  criticism of the quality of indonesian beans as "trade politics"
  and said jakarta's traditional links with dutch buyers meant it
  did not have any difficulty with exports.
indonesia and malaysia, asia's two biggest commodity
  producers, are expanding cocoa output and are both outside the
  international cocoa organization (icco).
officials have said malaysian production is expected to
  total 150,000 to 155,000 tonnes in calendar 1987.
this is up from 131,000 tonnes in 1986, partly because of
  the end of a three-year drought in sabah, the country's largest
  cocoa growing area.
production of indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31,600
  tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980.
output is
  projected to rise to 50,000 tonnes in 1988 from 38,000 tonnes
  this year as young trees mature.
both malaysia and indonesia are low cost producers and
  traders said they could last out low prices longer than west
  african countries.
according to one kuala lumpur trader, world prices would
  have to fall another 1,000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) to
  make cocoa production in malaysia uneconomic.
some traders believe the main quality problem is with
  harvesting and fermentation techniques.
one trader said malaysian cocoa is virtually
  indistinguishable from west african output if treated in the
  same way but this is not possible on the larger malaysian
  estates.
malaysia advised to raise crude oil output in 1988
  malaysia's national oil company,
  petronas, has advised the government to raise crude oil output
  to 540,000 barrels a day (bpd) in 1988 from a current 500,000
  bpd, a senior company official said.
"we have the capacity to produce the amount," rastam hadi,
  petronas's vice-president for upstream sector said.
the government will announce its decision on friday when it
  unveils the country's budget.
malaysia raised output this month
  to current levels from 420,000 bpd after reviewing the world
  oil market.
in may, malaysia cut output to 420,000 bpd from
  459,000 in response to a call by opec to boost prices.

  policy coordination based upon the louvre accord of february,
  he said.
the accord called for stability in foreign exchange
  rates.
exchange rates generally are regaining stability and the
  economies of industrialised nations are heading for a steady
  recovery, he said.
new zealand will continue firm monetary policy
  the reserve bank of new zealand said
  there was no evidence to suggest the fall in share prices had
  affected financial stability and it would maintain its firm
  monetary policy.
governor spencer russell said in a statement the central
  bank did not accept arguments that the battle against inflation
  should now take a low second priority after the sharemarket's
  plunge.
russell said the bank had two statutory responsibilities --
  to implement the government's monetary policy to bring down
  inflation, and to ensure the financial sector's stability.
"unless the bank is directed otherwise, the firm monetary
  policy will continue because it is very much in the national
  interest that it do so," he said.
"and there is yet no evidence available to the bank to
  suggest that the fall in share prices has affected the
  stability of the financial sector."
the barclays share index fell a record 504.75 points to
  2,925,26 on tuesday, a decline of 14.7 pct.

tanzania sells maize to malawi, mozambique, zaire
  tanzania has arranged to sell
  53,000 tonnes of maize to malawi, mozambique and zaire, radio
  tanzania said.
the radio said the grain would be delivered soon, but gave
  no details about the value of the sales.
tanzania is expecting a record maize harvest of 2.3 mln
  tonnes in the 1987/88 financial year ending june, up from a
  bumper crop of 2.1 mln in 1986/87.
tanzanian cotton threatened by lack of storage
  about 60,000 tonnes of harvested
  raw cotton may be spoiled by rain in tanzania's northern
  shinyanga region because it is stored in the open or in crude
  village sheds, radio tanzania reported.
the cotton, worth one billion shillings, cannot be moved to
  ginneries in the region because most mill warehouses are full.
many mills are not working because of a lack of spare parts, it
  added.
agriculture ministry officials have forecast a 1987/88
  cotton harvest of about 200,000 tonnes, down from 215,000 in
  1986/87.
aquino says manila watching interest rates closely
  president corazon aquino said the
  philippines was closely monitoring interest rates in the wake
  of monday's record drop on wall street and steep declines in
  manila and other asian stock markets.
"we will monitor these developments closely and will
  continue to hope that they do not precipitate large declines in
  economic activity around the world," aquino told a meeting of 13
  major philippine business groups.
"the philippines, as a trading country in the world economy,
  depends on the continued health and growth of both the world
  economy and the world trading system," she said.
the manila stock exchange composite index plunged 105.49
  points or 11.79 pct by the midday close to 789.54, depressed by
  the record 508 point fall of the dow jones industrial average
  on monday.
"the philippines, in addition, as a large borrower nation,
  is affected by developments in interest rate levels around the
  world and will carefully monitor the impact of these
  developments on interest rates, on gold and on commodity
  prices," aquino said.
"we welcome the statements from world leaders that urge calm
  in the present difficult situation," she added.
japan money growth to stay at 11-12 pct - official
  growth in japan's m-2 plus certificates of
  deposit (cd) money supply in the october to december period is
  not expected to accelerate, but will remain at high levels
  between 11 and 12 pct, a senior bank of japan official said.
the central bank will keep a watch on high growth in
  liquidity because this is a factor that may cause rises in
  prices of goods, he said.
the september growth of 11.1 pct year on year announced
  earlier today should not be taken as implying that the money
  supply has started to expand very rapidly, he said.
in august
  the rate of increase was 11.0 pct.
world could cope with hormuz closure, subroto says
  oil prices would skyrocket for a time if
  conflict in the gulf closed the strait of hormuz, but oil
  supplies could be adjusted to take care of world demand,
  indonesian energy minister subroto said.
he made no explicit reference to the latest u.s. military
  action in the gulf.
but in an address to a conference of the indonesian
  petroleum association, he said, "if worst comes to worst and say
  the flow of oil through the straits of hormuz is completely
  shut off, i believe the world oil supply, given time to adjust,
  can take care of the situation."
"but this is not to say that prices, at least for a short
  duration, will not skyrocket as speculators take advantage of
  the situation," he declared.
tensions in the gulf, however, usually had a relatively
  short-term impact on prices, he added.
assessing future price trends, he said, "short-term spot
  prices will probably still fluctuate, but they will most likely
  hover around the official opec price basket of 18 dlrs per
  barrel.
"the upward deviations, however, are likely to be greater
  than the downward ones."
"the balance between supply and demand in the short term
  will still be delicate," he added.
"non-opec production may still
  go up, competing with opec for the expected additional increase
  in world demand."
subroto, a member of opec's three-man quota committee which
  has been touring cartel members, said speculation may play
  havoc with spot prices, but opec was trying to stabilize the
  situation by urging cooperation by non-opec producers.
in the medium term, non-opec production would reach a
  plateau in the early 1990s, leaving opec much stronger, he
  said.

iranian tanker reports sighting mine in gulf
  an iranian shuttle tanker reported
  spotting a floating mine in the central gulf on tuesday about
  50 miles west of lavan island, regional shipping sources said.
the khark iii, owned by the national iranian tanker co,
  gave the position of the mine as 27 degrees 14 minutes north,
  52.06 east.
there was no indication of measures being taken against the
  mine, which is in iranian territorial waters.
faber open for offers on morgan grenfell stake
  willis faber plc &lt;wifl.l> chairman and
  chief executive david palmer said the company would consider
  any bid for its 20.8 pct shareholding in morgan grenfell group
  plc &lt;mgfl.l> but had not yet received any offers.
"we will entertain any approaches," he told reuters in reply
  to questions, following u.k. press speculation.
in an earlier statement, faber said that if an offer were
  to be received for its stake in the merchant banking group, "it
  would be considered on its merits."
corby distilleries to expand in canada
  &lt;corby distilleries ltd>, 52 pct owned by
  allied lyons plc &lt;alld.l> subsidiary &lt;hiram walker-goodman &amp;
  worts> is to buy the spirits business of &lt;mcguinness distillers
  ltd> of toronto for 45 mln canadian dlrs.
mcguinness is a producer and marketer of spirits and also
  has exclusive agencies for some imported wines and spirits.
the sale is subject to the approval of the bureau of
  competition policy.
michael jackaman, president and chief
  executive officer of hiram walker and allied vintners, said,
  "the acquisition is an excellent one both commercially and
  financially."
poehl says rate rises are cause for concern
  rises in west german and international
  interest rates are a cause for concern and the bundesbank has
  no interest in higher capital market rates, bundesbank
  president karl otto poehl said.
"we consider the interest rate increase that has occurred
  here and internationally to be a problem and cause for concern,"
  poehl told an investment conference.
"i would like to stress that the bundesbank has no interest
  in higher capital market rates," he said.
shortly after poehl spoke, the bundesbank announced a
  tender for a securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80
  pct.
previous tenders over the last month by interest rate have
  seen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to 3.85 pct
  at last week's pact from 3.60 on the last fixed-rate tender in
  late september.
the bundesbank's reduction of the key allocation rate to
  3.80 from 3.85 pct was heralded monday by repeated injections
  of money market liquidity at between 3.70 and 3.80 pct.
these moves to cap interest rates followed a meeting
  between poehl, finance minister gerhard stoltenberg and u.s.
  treasury secretary james baker monday in frankfurt.
officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmed
  their commitment to the louvre accord on currency stability.
over the weekend, criticism by baker of the tightening in
  west german monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of the
  dollar on speculation that louvre cooperation had ended.
but the dollar rallied on news of monday's meeting in
  nervous trading to trade above 1.79 marks tuesday.
poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was not
  due to central bank policy, but to markets' expectations, and
  currency developments.
commenting on the inflationary expectations, poehl said "you
  have to get to the root of the problem, you have to pursue a
  policy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears."
the inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated, he
  said.
poehl rebuffed recent u.s.
criticism of west germany,
  saying the bundesbank had made a substantial contribution to
  international cooperation in interest and monetary policy.
the bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its money
  supply target, arousing criticism from other quarters, he said.
"today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of
  1986... quite the contrary of other countries, where interest
  rates have risen substantially more," poehl said.
this had to be taken into account when considering recent
  rises in repurchase pact allocation rates, which were due to
  rising international money market rates that had spilled over
  into the german market, he said.
poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so far
  ignored improvements in the u.s.
deficits.
"the adjustment process in the u.s. trade balance is
  definitely underway," he said, noting that this was not so
  noticeable in absolute figures.
the spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had also
  attracted little attention, he said.
lawson says bp share offer going ahead
  u.k. chancellor of the exchequer nigel
  lawson said the government was going ahead with this month's
  flotation of british petroleum co plc &lt;bp.l> shares despite the
  collapse on international stock markets.
"we are going ahead because the whole issue has been
  underwritten - we had it underwritten because there is always a
  risk of this sort of thing happening," lawson said in a bbc
  radio interview.
lawson's remarks came as renewed selling on the london
  stock market took bp shares down a further 33p to 283, well
  below the 330p price set for the around seven billion stg
  issue.
lawson said the u.k. economy is fundamentally sound and
  added that stock markets had reflected that recently.
"i profoundly believe in the market system as the best way
  for securing economic prosperity (but) that does not mean to
  say the markets are infallible."
"my advice to small investors...is to remain calm.
there is
  absolutely no reason not to do so," lawson said.
philippines applauds defeat of u.s. labelling bill
  the philippine coconut industry has
  greeted with relief the defeat in the u.s. senate of a bill
  requiring some edible oils to be labelled as saturated fats.
the bill, which was defeated by the senate agriculture
  committee on monday, could have cost about 60 mln dlrs a year
  in lost exports, the philippine coconut authority (pca) said.
"naturally, we welcomed the defeat but there is a chance the
  bill will be resurrected and attached as a rider to another
  senate bill," a spokesman for the united coconut association of
  the philippines (ucap).
pca chairman jose romero noted the vote was close, with
  eight senators voting for it, 10 against and one abstaining.
the ucap spokesman said the american soybean association
  (asa) had spent about 25 mln dlrs lobbying for the bill.
he said the asa also had obscured the health issue during
  the debate.
"coconut oil is high in saturated fats, but unlike saturated
  animal fats, they do not enter the blood and lymph systems
  leaving fatty deposits connected to heart disease," he said.
u.s.
soybean and cottonseed producers had argued that
  saturated fats cause heart disease and that the labels would
  discourage consumption by health conscious consumers in favour
  of domestic unsaturated alternatives.
opponents of the bill said the proposal discriminated
  against imports and would damage the philippines, malaysia and
  indonesia.
the philippines earned 488 mln dlrs from coconut products
  in 1986, up from 477 mln in 1985, ucap figures show.
exports to the united states for edible and non-edible use
  account for about half of that total, pca's romero said.
tokyo stock plunge could force easier money policy
  plunging tokyo stock prices will prevent
  the bank of japan from raising its discount rate and could even
  force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues,
  government and private economists said.
a rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark
  further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major
  deflationary impact on the real economy, they said.
although bank of japan officials have consistently
  maintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discount
  rate, many in the markets have thought otherwise.
fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the
  central bank's apparent decision last week to countenance
  higher rates on commercial bills, dealers said.
but today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15
  pct -- means that the bank of japan would be hard pressed to
  raise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about a
  renewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said.
japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the
  markets concluded that the stock market's collapse precluded
  the central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount
  rate increase.
a senior government economist suggested that both the u.s.
  and japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a
  further drop in new york and tokyo stock prices.
"they need to
  support the stock and security markets," he said.
but bank of japan officials said they saw no need to change
  policy for the moment, although one admitted that the central
  bank may have to rethink its strategy if tokyo stock prices
  continue to plunge during the rest of the week.
both government and bank of japan economists agreed the
  economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary
  impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago.
with the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop in
  stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and
  business confidence, one government economist said.
"there will be some impact on the real economy, but it won't
  be that big," said another.
individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their
  own, although they do participate through trust funds and other
  investment vehicles.
and while many manufacturing firms turned
  to financial market investments for profits during last year's
  economic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them to
  refocus their attention on their core businesses, he said.
paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that is
  partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have
  shifted funds away from financial investments to increase
  inventories and step up capital spending, one government
  economist said.
in deciding what response to make to the steep stock price
  drop, the bank of japan must first determine whether prices
  will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a
  greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation,
  one central bank official said.
"that will at least take a
  couple of days, if not weeks," he said.

stoltenberg says meeting with baker underscored monetary cooperation

   stoltenberg says meeting with baker underscored monetary cooperation
stoltenberg says baker meeting underscores accord
  west german finance minister gerhard
  stoltenberg said the meeting on monday with u.s. treasury
  secretary james baker underscored the determination of the u.s.
  and west germany to continue close cooperation to stabilise
  foreign exchange rates.
stoltenberg told a news conference "the statement released
  yesterday (monday) after the private meeting ....
emphasized
  our determination to continue the close economic cooperation
  regarding foreign exchange stabilization and monetary policy."
stoltenberg said that he, baker and bundesbank president
  karl otto poehl had a very constructive discussion and had all
  reached a positive evaluation of the louvre accord during their
  meeting on monday.
stoltenberg said initial contacts with several european
  counterparts showed that they shared this view.
"we expect the
  declaration of our unified position to have a positive effect,"
  he said.
he noted that the dollar firmed again in late u.s. trading
  after the outcome of the baker meeting was published.
inro council meeting adjourned until thursday
  a council meeting of the
  international natural rubber organization (inro) has been
  adjourned until thursday as tomorrow is a malaysian national
  holiday, officials of the organisation said.
the main issue at the talks, which opened here yesterday,
  has been the inro buffer stock and the manner in which the
  buffer stock manager should continue to sell rubber after the
  current international pact for the commodity expires on october
  22, they said.
the deadline for the start of the new pact is january 1989.
buffer stock manager aldo hofmeister has been mandated to
  continue selling rubber during the interim period.
other issues discussed include ratification of the new
  accord, the officials said.
only malaysia of the pact's 32 producing and consuming
  member countries had ratified the new agreement by the
  beginning of this month.
the meeting is due to end on thursday.
louvre accord vital to w.germany - stoltenberg
  west german finance minister gerhard
  stoltenberg said the louvre accord was vital to west germany.
stoltenberg told a news conference "given west germany's
  unusually high dependence on world trade and exports, it is
  vital for west germany ... to continue its constructive
  contribution to trusting (international) cooperation on the
  basis of the louvre accord."
some monetary analysts have speculated that
  inflation-conscious bundesbank vice president helmut
  schlesinger may have been leading the central bank to a course
  of tighter monetary policy.
stoltenberg is due to attend a routine bundesbank meeting
  on thursday in west berlin.
he declined to forecast what, if
  any, policy decisions the bundesbank might take.

  west german finance minister gerhard
  stoltenberg declined to comment on whether unpublished target
  zones for currencies agreed at last february's louvre accord
  had been changed as a result of the meeting on monday with u.s.
  treasury secretary james baker.
he was asked about target zones at a news conference in
  bonn.
stoltenberg referred to a statement released after
  monday's meeting, which said continuing cooperation was aimed
  at promoting currency stability at current levels.
this was the
  same formula used in the text of the louvre accord, he noted.
stoltenberg does not rule out intervention
  west german finance minister gerhard
  stoltenberg said he could not rule out the possibility of
  central bank intervention to support currencies.
asked at a news conference whether central banks were
  prepared to intervene to defend currencies, he said "we cannot
  rule out the use of any instrument which leads to foreign
  currency stability."
however, he added that in the end, it was market forces
  which prevailed.
iran says u.s.
raid caused 500 mln dlrs damage
  u.s.
attacks on two iranian oil platforms
  in the gulf -- both of which were still blazing -- caused
  damage estimated at 500 mln dlrs, tehran radio quoted iranian
  oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh as saying.
the rigs, one of which was heavily shelled by four american
  destroyers on monday, were still burning almost 24 hours after
  the attack and could cause widespread pollution in the gulf,
  the minister told a news conference in tehran.
he said the
  reshadat rigs, 120 miles (200 km) east of bahrain in
  international waters, were in the final stages of
  reconstruction after an attack by iraqi jets last year.
iranian premier reiterates warning of retaliation
  iranian premier mir-hossein mousavi
  reiterated his country would retaliate for u.s. navy attacks on
  gulf oil platforms.
"the u.s.
attack on iran's oil platforms jeopardises our
  national sovereignty ... and we will retaliate properly for
  this perfidious american aggression," mousavi told a news
  conference in damascus.
on monday u.s. navy warships blasted
  the rostam platform, and navy personnel stormed a second
  platform a few miles away.
washington said the operation was
  aimed at destroying positions used by iran to track and assault
  neutral gulf shipping.
indonesia finds new offshore oil and gas resources
  the indonesian state-owned oil company
  pertamina has found new offshore oil and gas resources in east
  aceh, on the western tip of northern sumatra, a company
  spokesman said.
the spokesman said the discovery was made at the gos ia-1
  offshore exploratory well about 38 kms east of langsa in aceh.
"oil and gas are found in sand layers at the depth of 2,300
  metres within the baong formation," he said.
he said preliminary tests showed that the well could flow
  oil at the rate of 1,320 barrels a day with 50 degrees api at
  20 degrees centigrade through a 5/8 inch choke.
"the well also flows natural gas at the rate of 12 mln
  standard cubic feet a day," he added.
gos ia-1 well, located at a water depth of 41 metres, was
  drilled under a production sharing contract between pertamina
  and japex north sumatra ltd, each having 50 pct shares.
"petroleum operations are to be carried out by pertamina as
  operator through a joint operating body established by the two
  companies," the pertamina spokesman stated.
the contract covers the gebang block contract area.
the two
  companies have previously completed the drilling of gos iia-1
  exploratory well, around 14 kms south of gos ia-1.
indonesia says it will extend oil contracts
  indonesia told the oil industry on
  tuesday it will extend contracts on producing blocks and
  improve the investment climate, but wants to see increased
  expenditure on exploration in return.
president suharto, in an opening speech to the indonesian
  petroleum association, said indonesia was ready to extend
  contracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas.
"in order to boost investment in the petroleum industry, the
  government of indonesia has basically approved of extending
  production sharing contracts under the present laws," suharto
  said.
"apart from that, the government will keep improving the
  investment climate in order to accelerate the development of
  the petroleum industry," he said.
indonesian energy minister subroto told the association he
  was aware that the oil industry needed to be assured that
  contracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would be
  renewed before they would invest in further exploration.
"as we all have heard this morning, the president is fully
  aware of this situation," subroto said.
"the government has already made the political decision to
  entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers
  to continue their activities in indonesia, albeit on a
  selective basis."
indonesia, one of the 13 members of opec, must find new oil
  reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade, oil
  industry sources say.
subroto said the government was also working to ease other
  problems, including granting easier terms for remote areas or
  deep water conditions.
but subroto said relations with oil companies were two-way
  and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now
  that the oil price had recovered.
president suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of
  technology to indonesian companies, and more help from the oil
  industry for the regions in which companies operated.
abdul rachman ramly, the president of state oil company
  pertamina, has said that budgeted exploration and production
  expenditure for all oil companies in indonesia was forecast to
  fall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in
  1986.
pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operation
  contracts with foreign oil companies.
subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field
  operations was a government priority.
there had been
  misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry
  in certain areas, such as when a field is designated
  commercial, and a thorough evaluation was being made.
he said the government wanted to finalise contract
  extensions as soon as practical, and urged the industry in the
  meantime to maintain its exploration drive.
subroto said indonesia needed the companies to maintain
  exploration efforts, even if their contract was due to expire
  within 10 years.
"this need in itself is some sort of guarantee
  that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement."
eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal
  between 1991 and 2001, industry sources said.
extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved
  detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted.
subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions
  would be selective, based on how much capital would be
  invested.

iran plans to file lawsuits over u.s.
raid
  iran is preparing lawsuits to file for
  compensation from the u.s. over the american raid on its gulf
  oil platforms, tehran radio quoted iranian oil minister
  gholamreza aqazadeh as saying.
the lawsuits would be filed with competent international
  bodies once the exact damage was calculated, he was quoted
  telling a news conference in tehran.
he earlier estimated the
  damage from the u.s.
raid at about 500 mln dlrs.
the rigs, one of which was heavily shelled by four american
  destroyers on monday, were still burning almost 24 hours after
  the attack, he said.
aqazadeh said the half-billion-dollar damage estimate was
  preliminary.
washington has said the attack was in response to
  a missile strike against the american-flag tanker the sea isle
  city in kuwaiti waters on friday.
he denied that there was any military hardware on the rigs
  "except a 23 mm machinegun for air defence."
reacting to
  weinberger's remark that washington considered the case closed,
  aqazadeh said: "iran will also consider the case closed after
  its retaliatory measure."
iranian officials have said their
  response would not be limited to the gulf and u.s.
interests
  around the world might come under attack.
aqazadeh said the u.s. military presence in the gulf
  aggravated the regional crisis and made access to the region's
  oil more difficult, but he did not see the u.s.
attack
  significantly affecting oil prices.
irna said he gave no explicit reply when asked if the
  attack would prompt iran to block the hormuz strait at the
  entrance to the gulf.
"if iran cannot use the hormuz strait, no other country can
  either, and this would be to everyone's harm," the radio quoted
  him as saying.
iranian premier reiterates warning of retaliation

  chemical bank and marine midland banks
  inc said they are cutting their prime lending rate to 9-1/4 pct

  last week.
the reduction is effective immediately.
no other major u.s. bank had followed the lead of chemical
  and marine midland, preferring to keep their prime rates at
  9-1/4 pct while they waited to see what course money market
  rates would take.
following monday's record fall in wall street stock prices,
  money market rates fell sharply on tuesday as investors
  ploughed proceeds into short-term instruments and the federal
  reserve said it is prepared to provide liquidity to support the
  economy and the financial system.
eurodollar deposit rates in london fell by as much as 9/16
  percentage point, treasury bill rates fell by as much as half a

speculation even surfaced of a discount

u.s. coffee import reporting system questioned
  a voluntary compliance system for
  monitoring u.s. coffee imports under quotas is viewed
  skeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts and
  trade sources.
"many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and 
  importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because of
  the past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it
  became a matter of the trade monitoring each other," one
  analyst said.
on monday, a national coffee association newsletter said
  the office of u.s. trade representative will implement a
  voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to
  monitor imports is tied up in the congressional trade bill.
under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffee
  importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the
  u.s. government until congress approves the monitoring
  authority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification,
  it will still be allowed entry.
while many believe producers will not seek to add to the
  overburdened stock situation in the u.s., others believe some
  will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of
  monitoring controls, trade sources said.
"last time, there was a lot of false information submitted
  to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines," a
  u.s. customs spokesman said.
"customs can do a good job when given the tools, but when
  its hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demand
  form o (documents tracking merchandise from source to
  destination)," he said.
many see it as a true test of whether producers and
  importers will abide by the quota system.
"it is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the
  quota agreement," said one major u.s. roaster.
"last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade did
  not act as a gentleman," said another analyst adding, "without
  the need to submit documents, the ball will be in the
  producers' hands."
some feel that importers will take advantage of the
  voluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market,
  in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount.
many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member
  countries at discounts and then bring it into the u.s. falsely
  labelled.
according to customs officials, several green coffee
  importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee
  fraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations,
  forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy
  beans.
"if there's that much of a discrepancy between prices for
  one country and another, producers may be teted to get rid of
  their stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by
  circumventing the quota provisions," said paine webber analyst
  bernie savaiko.
still, others believe that producers will not be hard
  pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in
  the u.s. in the near term.
"it would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not
  have some share of connivance, but i think the voluntary system
  seemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have so
  much coffee, i don't think that it poses that much of a
  threat," one trader said.

oilmeal demand still strong in u.s., soviet union
  oilmeal demand remained strong in the
  united states in july and august and six pct up on levels seen
  in the same months last year, with most of the rise coming in
  soymeal, the hamburg based publication oil world said.
total u.s domestic usage of the nine major oilmeals rose to
  a record 19 mln tonnes in october 1986/august 1987, up 4.2 pct
  on the same year-ago period, with the increase in soymeal at
  seven pct, it said.
soviet soymeal demand rose by 310,000 tonnes in july and
  330,000 tonnes in august over the respective year-ago months
  following a huge increase in soymeal imports.
oil world presumed some imports were not used immediately
  but went into stocks.
with imports again large in september, it
  estimated soviet soymeal stocks sharply up at 800,000 tonnes by
  october 1 from around 130,000 at the same time last year.
ec oilmeal demand rose 100,000 tonnes in august from a year
  earlier, with soymeal up 45,000 tonnes.
crushings of rapeseed,
  sunseed and soybeans will probably rise from last year due to
  bumper ec crops.
it estimated the ec rapeseed crop at a record
  5.9 mln tonnes, up from 3.7 mln last year.
rapeseed disposals
  were reported at 2.1 mln tonnes by september 20 against 1.4 mln
  at that time last year.

crazy eddie &lt;crzy.o> amends shareholder rights
  crazy eddie inc said its board of
  directors amended the company's shareholder rights plan in
  moves it said were designed to preserve stockholder protection
  and provide flexibility to the plan.
yesterday, crazy eddie agreed not to oppose a slate of
  candidates to its board proposed by the committee to restore
  stockholder value, a shareholder group led by the
  &lt;oppenheimer-palmieri fund l.p.> and entertainment marketing
  inc &lt;em>, that has been seeking to oust current management.
crazy eddie said the new amendments limit future amendments
  to the plan, modify the definition of "continuing directors"
  and permit amendment or termination of the plan with the
  consent of the company's shareholders if there are no
  continuing directors in office or the approval of at least
  three such directors cannot be obtained.
the company also said it approved a certificate of
  designation with respect to its 4.5 mln shares of authorized,
  but previously undesignated and unissued shares of preferred
  stock and adopted an employee stock ownership plan.
crazy eddie also that it requested that the shareholder
  group make a commitment not to take the company private until
  crazy eddie has had a chance to recover from current financial
  difficulties, a committment that the group rejected.
crazy eddie said it will hold its annual shareholders

reagan sends int'l rubber agreement to senate
  president reagan sent the five-year
  international natural rubber agreement to the senate for
  approval.
reagan said the accord is designed to stabilize rubber
  prices without disturbing long-term market trends and to foster
  expanded natural rubber supplies at reasonable prices.
it continues a buffer stock of not more than 550,000 tonnes
  established by a 197agreement.
this will be used to defend a
  regularly adjusted price range and will be financed equally by
  importing and exporting members of the agreement.
no pressing need for soviet wheat subsidy - lyng
  the soviets have not indicated an
  urgent need for a u.s. wheat subsidy offer, and it is unlikely
  that such an offer will be ma during the u.s./soviet summit
  expected to be held next month, agriculture secretary richard
  lyng told reuters.
in an exclusive interview with reuters, lyng said he did
  not know if the united states will offer moscow another wheat
  subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.
"last year it was well into the year before we offered it.
there's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me that
  there's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (a
  wheat subsidy)."
when asked if a subsidy would be offered at a u.s./soviet
  summit, lyng said, "no, i don't think so.
i don't think that."
the agriculture secretary said a u.s. wheat subsidy deal to
  moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for
  discussion at a summit.
"it would not be the kind of issue that the president or the
  chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions
  about," lyng said.
"when mr. nikonov (communist party secretary for
  agriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat was
  not something that would be discussed with the president of the
  united states.
he said it's not presidential," lyng said.
lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major
  producing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and the
  still unfinished soviet grain harvest could delay any final
  decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to moscow.
the future of the u.s./soviet long-term grains agreement
  will be discussed the first of next year, lyng said, but the
  agriculture secretary questioned the benefits of the
  long-standing agreement.
"we've had three years in a row in which the soviets have
  failed to live up to their end of the agreement ... we would
  love to continue to keep doing busines with the soviet union,
  but do we need a long-term agreement.
who benefits from that.
these are some of the questions we need to discuss."
when asked if he felt the united states has benefitted from
  the agreement, lyng said, "i don't know.
it certainly hasn't
  been what we had hoped it would be.
for three years running
  they've (moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was an
  agreement."
lyng says india food aid package not ready
  the united states and india have
  not yet agreed on a food aid package to help the
  drought-stricken asian country, agriculture secretary richard
  lyng said.
lyng told reuters in an interview that the two countries
  have been discussing a package but that he did not expect the
  specifics of the offer to be announced during indian prime
  minister rajiv gandhi's visit here this week.
"we have been talking about the potential needs that india
  might have for both their commercial market and purchases needs
  as well as the possibilities of assistance," lyng said.
"at this point, there is no detailed plan or program.
the
  amounts of what commodities are uncertain.
but we have
  indicated to the indians that we stand ready to assist in
  whatever way they deem most valuable," he said.
there has been speculation in trade circles that usda would
  offer india subsidized vegetable oil under the export
  enhancement program and donate surplus corn under section 419
  of an amended 1949 law.
lyng indicated the two countries have been unable to agree
  on the mix of concessional and commercial aid, and that
  washington would prefer the package include something other
  than donated food.
"the indians are capable of purchasing a lot, of taking care
  of themselves.
india is a country that has come a long way in
  its ability to produce food and they have a great pride in
  that," lyng said.
"we (the united states) obviously, with the surpluses we
  still have of many commodities..., would like to share in the
  import business the indians do, and then we have some, as we
  always do, compassion for the people of india and would like to
  cooperate with them," he said.
lyng said he had no plans to meet with indian officials
  during gandhi's visit here, adding, "i just don't know of
  anything that might be announced specifically."
asked if "the ball was in the indians' court," he said, "yes."
gandhi is to leave washington tuesday evening.

louvre reaffirmation not enough - u.k. analysts
  u.s. and west german reaffirmation of
  support for the louvre accord cannot cure the fundamental
  problems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind the
  current collapse in stock markets, london economists said.
"there's going to have to be some acknowledgement that the
  dollar is going to be allowed to slip," said richard jeffrey of
  hoare govett.
"if not, there is going to be continued fear that
  when pressure emerges on the dollar, the fed will be forced to
  tighten.
this throws up the economic abyss of recession in the
  u.s. with obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world."
but some economists added that wall street's crash, which
  dragged other major markets down with it, may help curb the
  very problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation
  fears and the massive and persistent u.s. trade deficits.
"if there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in wall street
  ...it's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide," said
  geoffrey dennis of brokers james capel, echoing comments from
  other london and tokyo analysts.
lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of
  further falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationary
  pressures and import demand in the u.s., they say.
such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the
  equity crash, according to mike osborne of kleinwort grieveson.
"it would be suicidal for any government in the context of
  what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their
  interest rates," he added.
stocks surged after news chemical bank cut its prime
  lending rate half a point to 9.25 pct tuesday and u.s. fed
  chairman alan greenspan pledged support for the financial
  system.
the news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock
  collapse would spill over into the economy, via a banking
  crisis for example, thus precipitating recession.
it also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of
  1.8200 marks from a european low of 1.7880.
but economists said
  today's whiplash moves do not have long term significance and
  that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in
  mind.
"the united states has been able to live on borrowed time.
if the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic
  growth not recession...it contains good news (and) provides a
  more realistic assessment of the u.s. economy," said capel's
  dennis.
but he added that markets are still very much in
  danger.
"the liquidity doesn't disappear...all it's doing is
  disappearing from the equity markets," dennis noted.
david morrison of goldman sachs international said world
  market turbulence will be exacerbated if the group of seven
  (g-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar,
  as implied by west german finance minister gerhard
  stoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currencies
  is still on.
last week's dollar fall was partly triggered by
  expectations that the germans were more worried about the money
  supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency
  stability.
but rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, said
  morrison.
"the louvre accord is fundamentally misconceived.
to
  stabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong," he said.
new container cranes arrive at tanzania port
  two large container cranes donated
  by the danish international development agency (danida) have
  arrived in dar es salaam where they will help to increase the
  port's cargo handling capacity, port officials said.
the two new container cranes join one danish container
  crane already installed in the port, which is an important
  trade outlet for tanzania, zambia, malawi and eastern zaire.
five more cranes from finland are due to arrive soon,
  increasing the container terminal's handling capacity to
  120,000 units per year from 30,000 at present, the officials
  said.
u.k. credit policy seen steady, despite bank data
  an unexpectedly heavy 4.4 billion stg
  surge in u.k. september sterling bank lending is unlikely to
  nudge the bank of england towards tightening monetary policy as
  long as sterling remains in its present robust state,
  economists said.
an acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the
  past two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit
  demand which has largely been behind growth in lending.
"in the normal course of events the markets would have been
  extremely worried about that figure," noted peter spencer, u.k.
economist with credit suisse first boston.
after an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data,
  which compared won stg august rise, u.k.
  government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to flee
  from plummetting equities into the relative security of
  government securities.
equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching a
  day's low of 1,766.7 on the ftse 100 index after the data,
  before staging a recovery.
sterling held its buoyant tone
  throughout.
u.k. money market rates, in a similarly calm response,
  resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning
  after little more than a token blip as the figures came out.
noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks
  would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a
  rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, "with
  the financial markets doing what they're doing, that's the last
  thing the bank of england would want to do," spencer said.
"the monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as
  sterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,"
  said kevin boakes, chief u.k.
economist at greenwell montagu
  gilt edged.
boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money
  measure m0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from august's 4.5 pct
  growth, which he said must cause some concern at the treasury.
but "the fact that overall broad money growth has slowed
  down is a rather encouraging sign," noted paul temperton, u.k.
economist with merrill lynch capital markets.
he pointed to a
  fall in the year-on-year growth rate of the m3 broad money
  aggregate to 19.5 pct in september from august's 22 pct.
it was concern about credit growth which prompted the bank
  of england to engineer a one point rise in u.k. bank base rates
  to 10 pct in early august, caution endorsed subsequently by
  news of a massive 4.9 billion stg july rise in bank lending.
temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry in
  that period had been the behaviour of u.k. asset markets.
housing and equities were the key two asset markets in
  influencing consumer behaviour, he said.
in the light of the precipitous falls on u.k. equity
  markets in the past few days, "there will almost certainly be a
  straightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail
  sales," temperton said.
"almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in
  consumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues," he added.
"i think the stock market has decided that the bank lending
  figure is a thing of the past...we are talking about a very
  serious panic and a flight to quality," spencer said.
a u.k. treasury official said that it was important to look
  at all the monetary information, not just the bank lending,
  adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly
  than bank lending.
senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending
  was evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy
  personal sector borrowing.
figures from the banking information service showed
  personal sector lending by u.k. clearing banks rose by 1.66
  billion stg in september after a 978 mln stg august rise.
much
  of the rise reflected quarterly interest payments.
fed expected to add reserves via customer rps
  the federal reserve is expected to enter
  the government securities market to add reserves via customer
  repurchase agreements, economists said.
they expected the amount to total around 1.5 billion to two
  billion dlrs.
economists added that the low rate on federal funds
  indicates the fed is unlikely to add funds agressively through
  overnight system repurchases, unless it feels the need to calm
  volatile financial markets.
federal funds were trading at 7-1/8 pct, down from
  yesterday's average of 7.61 pct.
taiwan foreign exchange reserves hit record high
  taiwan's foreign exchange reserves, bouyed
  by rising exports, have hit a record high and are likely to
  soar to 72 billion u.s. dlrs by the year end, central bank
  officials said tuesday.
central bank governor chang chi-cheng told reporters the
  reserves totalled about 69 billion u.s. dlrs, compared with
  about 42 billion at the same time last year and 68 billion on
  october 5.
he declined to elaborate.
a senior bank official, who declined to be named, told
  reuters the reserves were likely to reach 72 billion dlrs at
  the end of the year.
"the surge in reserves is the result of our trade surplus
  and recent purchases of u.s.
dollars on the local interbank
  market," chang said.
taiwan's trade surplus hit a record 14.95 billion u.s. dlrs
  in the first nine months of 1987 compared with 11.05 billion a
  year earlier, official figures show.
vice economic minister wang chien-hsien said the surplus
  will rise to about 20 billion dlrs by the end of the year.
about 80 pct of the surplus will come from the island's trade
  with the united states.
chien said taiwan's trade will reach 80 billion u.s. dlrs
  this year compared with 63.96 billion last year.
its exports are expected to total 50 billion and imports 30
  billion against exports of 39.79 billion and imports of 24.17
  billion last year.

norway boosts oil output by 22 pct in september
  norway's september oil output rose by 22.2
  pct to 1.07 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 830,492 bpd in
  august, according to a reuter survey of firms operating here.
operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output at
  several of norway's biggest fields and resumed production at
  fields shut down for 27 days in august for the ekofisk field
  rescue project.
industry analysts said the increase did not exceed norway's
  voluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oil
  output, a move designed to back opec-led efforts to stabilise
  oil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets.
norway, not an opec member, decided in june to extend the
  production restraints, enforced since february 1 1987, on all
  its north sea fields for the rest of the year.
oil minister arne oeien said last month he expected norway
  would extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth.
the biggest increase was seen on the ekofisk field, which
  pumped 168,023 bpd in september against 48,195 bpd in august,
  field operator phillips petroleum norway inc said.
ekofisk and the nearby valhall and ula fields, which use
  the ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of august while
  phillips raised ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence.
bp petroleum development norway ltd, operator of the ula
  field, said september output rose to 86,727 bpd after dropping
  to 27,237 bpd in august because of the shutdown.
valhall, operated by amoco norway a/s, flowed 74,694 bpd
  last month compared with 69,748 bpd in august, the company
  said.
september production was also sharply higher at the
  statfjord field.
norway's 84 pct share of statfjord, which
  extends into the british north sea sector, was 611,138 bpd
  against 552,646 bpd in august, operator den norske stats
  oljeselskap a/s (statoil) said.
norway's 22.2 pct share of the murchison field which, like
  statfjord, extends into the british sector, yielded 15,388 bpd
  in september, a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previous
  month, norwegian partners on the british-operated field said.
statoil boosted output at its gullfaks field to 109,670 bpd
  in september, compared with 100,188 in august.
norsk hydro, operator of the oseberg field, said test
  output at the field from the mobile production ship petro jarl
  totalled 1,719 bpd last month, down sharply from 16,170 bpd in
  august.
hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring on
  stream a second well, cutting september production to just two
  days.

iran leader vows revenge on us raid in coming days
  iran's top war spokesman ali akbar
  hashemi rafsanjani on tuesday called the u.s.
attacks on two of
  its gulf oil platforms an escalation and promised retaliation.
"god willing, we will carry out our duty in the coming days
  and make them sorry," said rafsanjani in a speech to parliament
  later broadcast by tehran radio.
the tehran leadership have been quick to threaten vengeance
  after the u.s. raids on the rigs, one of which was destroyed.
president ali khamenei, prime minister mir-hossein mousavi
  and now rafsanjani within 24 hours of the u.s. action have all
  vowed retaliation.
rafsanjani, the parliamentary speaker, said, "it is not a
  threat or an attempt at intimidation when we say we will
  respond to aggression -- it is a reality and we have proved it
  in practice."
he added that the american attack "squares neither
  with its superpower image nor its claim of concern with
  security, nor reason and wisdom."
u.s.
warships shelled an iranian offshore oil platform and
  american special forces boarded another, destroying equipment.
the u.s. government said the attack was a measured response
  to an iranian missile attack on the american-flagged kuwaiti
  tanker sea isle city in kuwaiti waters last friday.

  u.s. agriculture secretary richard
  lyng said he is pleased the european community plans to offer a
  global farm reform plan at gatt later this month, although the
  united states opposes key parts of the proposal.
"we're pleased that they have moved in tabling a proposal.
it will help us in getting the negotiations underway," lyng
  told reuters in an interview tuesday.
lyng's comment came after ec ministers in luxembourg
  endorsed a farm reform package drafted by the ec commission.
the ec plan will be presented at the next meeting of uruguay
  round agriculture negotiators in geneva on october 26.
lyng said the united states would oppose parts of the plan
  seeking a market sharing agreement for grains, and proposing
  curbs on u.s. soybean and cereal substitute exports to europe.
the u.s. in july proposed to gatt the elimination of all
  farm subsidies affecting trade within ten years, and has
  pressed the ec to make a counter-offer with the aim of reaching
  a global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988.
however, the ec and some u.s. domestic groups have said the
  reagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies is
  unrealistic.
asked about such criticism, lyng said "the alternative to
  doing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them.
i
  think that is the unrealistic position."
"i would suggest that they (ec) listen to what we are
  trying to say."
lyng also rejected suggestions the u.s. and ec agree a
  freeze in export subsidies to get the gatt negotiations 
  started.
"all that some countries would like to have would be a
  wheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat.
that doesn't do a thing for us," lyng said.
the united states wants an end to subsidies in a range of
  agricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils, he
  said.
at the gatt negotiators meeting next week canada is
  expected to offer a proposal as well as the ec.
the united states will be represented at the meeting by
  former agriculture undersecretary daniel amstutz, recently
  appointed special u.s. negotiator on agriculture.

bethlehem steel &lt;bs> sets steel price increases
  bethlehem steel corp said prices
  for steel sheet products will be increased up to 30 dlrs a ton
  effective january 3.
the increases will affect certain non-contract or spot
  transactions and will be achieved through reductions in
  competitive discounts.
the company said transaction prices for contract accounts,
  which have a duration of six months or more, will also be
  increased to commensurate levels.
percentage increases were not immediately available.
prices for flat-rolled steel sheet, used in automobiles,
  appliances and other products, vary widely between about 350
  and 800 dlrs a ton.
the company said it was taking the actions to restore sheet
  transaction prices to more equitable levels.
in many cases,
  prices are still lower than those attained in 1984, it said.
bethlehem also said that in response to changing market
  conditions and potential inflationary pressures, efforts will
  be made to mininize the number and the duration of firm price
  contracts.

ibc seeks export details to set coffee quotas
  the brazilian coffee institute
  (ibc) has given shippers until close of business on thursday to
  submit details of past export performance in order that
  individual quotas can be allocated, an ibc spokesman said.
he told reuters ibc president jorio dauster has confirmed
  acceptance of national coffee policy council (cnpc) proposals
  to establish individual export quotas based 65 pct on export
  performance, 25 pct on stocks and 10 pct by auction.
shippers can choose their best period of 12 consecutive
  months between april 1, 1985, and september 30, 1987, to be
  used for calculating the export performace portion.
the ibc will total all the figures, calculate each shippers
  participation and use this as a basis for allocation of
  individual quotas, the ibc spokesman said.
he said the ibc has already settled with the sao paulo
  mercantile exchange how the auction system will operate.
shippers can bid a premium over the contribution quota payable
  on coffee exports and the succesful bidder will add this
  premium to the contribution quota when he submits his export
  sales declaration form.
auctions will not start until after the opening of export
  registrations.
the spokesman could not say when this might be
  but trade sources said an announcement could come at the end of
  the week, opening registraions from monday.
a meeting has been set for tomorrow in brasilia of the
  cnpc's export marketing committee to establish a system for
  allocating the 25 pct of export quotas based on stock levels,
  the spokesman added.
a system of individual export quotas is being reestablished
  in brazil - a previous system was abandoned in 1985 - to ensure
  shipments are kept in line with the country's ico quota.

copa urges tax on vegetable proteins
  the european community's farmers'
  pressure group copa has urged ec farm ministers to agree a tax
  on vegetable proteins similar to the oils and marine fats tax
  which has already been proposed by the ec commission.
copa president hans kjeldsen told a news conference on
  tuesday he had also urged ministers to seek a similar mechanism
  for cereal substitutes.
he was speaking after a meeting of farm leaders with the
  danish foreign and agriculture ministers, who currently chair
  meetings of their ec colleagues.
kjeldsen said taxes on the products concerned would help
  the ec's budget problems and would provide some price stability
  for producers.
this would in turn help the market position for certain
  crops of which the ec is a net importer such as oilseeds, peas
  and beans, but for which the commission is now proposing severe
  output restrictions.
a minority of ec ministers opposed to an oils and fats tax
  on imported and domestically produced oils and marine fats
  succeeded in blocking the idea during this year's annual ec
  price fixing.
however, the ec commission has said it maintains its
  proposals for a tax.
kjeldsen said copa had urged the ministers to pursue
  international negotiations on farm trade with the aim of
  bridging the gap between ec and world prices.

jacobs sells stake in gillette &lt;gs>
  minneapolis investor irwin jacobs said he
  sold the stake he held in gillette co &lt;gs> after deciding that
  he could not force gillette to accept a 47 dlr a share takeover
  bid made by revlon group inc &lt;rev>.
revlon's bid expired last week after being repeatedly
  rejected by gillette.
jacobs had earlier considered waging a
  proxy fight over gillette.
jacobs told reuters he sold the gillette stake, which he
  called "substantial" but under five pct, a few weeks ago over a
  period of several days.
he said he sold the stock at a profit,
  but did not disclose the selling price.
gillette's stock was at 24-1/8, up 1/8, in morning trade,
  off the high of 45-7/8 reached after revlon announced its bid.
jacobs said he sold his gillette stake based on an
  "investment decision.
i surely did not see this happening," he
  said of monday's stock market free-fall.
a gillette spokesman said the mpany had no comment.
jacobs said he and fellow investor carl pohlad continue to
  hold a stake in allegheny international inc &lt;ag>.
in august
  they disclosed in a securities and exchange commission filing
  that they had acquired 854,900 shares, or 7.9 pct, of allegheny
  and would consideer seeking control of the company.

donald regan says u.s. should ease credit supply
  donald regan, president reagan's
  former chief of staff, said the government should loosen the
  money supply, try to keep interest rates down and try to reduce
  the federal budget and trade deficits to avoid a recession.
"i think what we have to face now is trying to preserve our
  economy," the one-time chairman of merrill lynch and co inc
  &lt;mer> said in an interview on the abc television network.
"we've got to loosen money, we've got to keep interest rates
  down.
we can't afford to let them go up.
that means we're going
  to have to work on our twin deficits, both the budget deficit
  and the trade deficit," regan said.
"i certainly wouldn't tighten money at this particular
  moment," regan said when asked about the prospects for a
  recession following monday's price drop on wall street.
"i think that if they were to do that, they'd create the
  same conditions that we did in '29...they choked off the money
  supply and what happened?
we went into a major recession.
i
  think that's the one thing we've got to avoid right now."
regan also called on the government to impose restrictions
  on program trading.
"i think that that's exacerbated,
  exaggerated this decline, and i think it's something that they
  must stop," he said.

gatt case against japan a model for u.s. - lyng
  agriculture secretary richard lyng
  said the ruling of a gatt panel on a u.s. trade complaint
  against japan, expected soon, may influence the u.s. stance in
  negotiations with tokyo on beef and citrus import quotas.
the ruling of a gatt tribunal on a u.s. demand that japan
  end quotas on 12 categories of food items is expected by the
  end of the year.
lyng said he is optimistic the ruling will
  favor the u.s.
      "these are quota items, and the principles that apply to
  them, it seems to me, will have some bearing on the question of
  whether you would have quotas or not on beef and citrus," lyng
  told reuters in an interview.
he repeated the u.s. demand that japan lift the quotas on
  beef and citrus after march 31, next year.
the japanese quotas on 12 food categories which the united
  states has challenged include items such as tomato paste, some
  cheeses and specialty fruit juices.
u.s. officials had hoped a ruling against the quotas would
  be issued earlier this year but the gatt panel decision has
  been delayed by the illness of the tribunal's chairman.
the u.s. has taken a hardline stance on the beef and citrus
  quotas, which tokyo says must remain in place to protect
  japanese farmers.
"we will not negotiate new quotas or accept new quotas (on
  beef and citrus).
if they impose them we would consider that an
  illegal action in the gatt, lyng said.
he declined to say what action the u.s. would take next
  april if japan continues to resist u.s. demands.

tin council allowed appeal on use of documents
  britain's highest court has decided the
  international tin council (itc) can appeal over the use of itc
  documents in court actions.
on november 2 the house of lords will decide if and to what
  extent itc documents, whether circulated or not, are admissible
  as court evidence.
lawyers working in the legal tangle left
  from the october 1985 collapse of the tin market said this
  hearing is likely to last a few days.
on wednesday the court of appeal will link the outstanding
  itc cases that have so far reached it and a single set of
  hearings could begin in early january, they added.
the house of lords ruling on the use of itc documents will
  be referred back to the action by two shearson lehman companies
  against the london metal exchange although the underlying case
  is not expected to be resumed until mid-1988.
the court of appeal hearings include action between brokers
  and cases by brokers and banks against the itc and the member
  governments of the tin council.
action taken by brokers seeking both the winding up of the
  itc or and placing it into receivership will also be covered by
  the court of appeal legal schedule.
iran, soviets to hold talks on oil exchange deal
  iran and the soviet union have

gennady gerasimov, chief of the soviet foreign ministry's
  information directorate, told reporters the agreement had been
  reached during a visit to moscow last week by iran's oil
  minister gholamreza aqazadeh.
gerasimov said no date had been set for the talks, which
  would also study the possibility of soviet technical assistance
  for iran's oil industry.
asa says ec oilseed policy illegal under gatt
  the american soybean association (asa)
  denounced european community (ec) oilseed policies as illegal
  under the general agreement on tariffs and trade, and
  threatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the ec does not
  remedy the situation.
asa vice president james adams told an asa-sponsored
  outlook 87 conference: "it will be filed unless the ec takes
  drastic and immediate steps."
"these subsidies are blatantly unfair and are gatt illegal,
  since they were established after the zero soybean duty was
  established in 1962," he said.
the asa's unfair trade petition against the ec would ask
  for an investigation and modification of ec oilseed policies to
  make the regime non-discriminatory.
the ec in 1962 ruled all ec oilseed imports duty-free, in
  an effort to fill its oilseed needs.
but ec oilseeds production
  has risen dramatically since then.
the ec now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above world
  market levels and is considering implementing a controversial
  oils and fats tax.
the subsidies "are obvious attempts to circumvent the zero
  duty binding and that makes u.s.
farmers mad as hell," adams
  said.
the asa is confident the u.s. congress will support its
  trade complaint, adams said.
the asa also strongly opposes an
  ec proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in the
  ec, which will be considered by the ec commission in december.
u.s.
soybean world market share has declined 35 pct in
  volume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result of
  ec policies, adams added.
lord plumb, european parliament president and a speaker at
  the conference, said the ec expanded oilseed production in 1973
  when the u.s.
halted overseas sales of soy products.
u.s. takes tough stand on gatt farm issues
  the united states is prepared to "pull out
  all the stops" to defend its agricultural trade rights under the
  general agreement on tariffs and trade (gatt), u.s.
ambassador
  to gatt michael samuels said.
those rights are now being challenged by the european
  community's (ec) agricultural support policies, he told a
  conference sponsored by the american soybean association.
he reiterated washington's firm intention to retaliate if
  the ec goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without
  the issue being investigated by a gatt special committee.
the u.s. claims the ec directive, due to come into effect
  on january 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of u.s. meat
  shipments into the ec.
the u.s. also will oppose all ec efforts to impair u.s.
  trade via the ec oilseeds regime, which supports ec oilseed
  prices over the current market level and which may be extended
  to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, samuels said.
reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies,
  an aim of most key participants in gatt multilateral trade
  negotiations, "is meaningless if import barriers continue to be
  erected," samuels said.
samuels called the u.s. plan to eliminate world farm
  subsidies by the year 2000, proposed at gatt in july, "visionary"
  and "very serious."
the ec and japan have said it is
  unrealistic.
the ec commission this month announced its draft proposal
  on farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at gatt formally
  next week.
the ec scheme involves emergency measures to reduce
  tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals
  substitutes, dairy and sugar.
it also calls for reduction of
  farm subsidies.
the u.s. is not opposed to short-term measures, as long as
  they are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major
  trade distortions, samuels said.
washington will review the ec proposal when it is formally
  submitted and respond to it officially then.
"we will consider its relation to the punta del este
  declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,"
  the u.s.
ambassador said.
the u.s. can say no to the ec proposal if the ec ignores
  the u.s. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.
the key difference between the two approaches is that the
  u.s. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the ec is pushing
  only for a reduction in farm suppports, samuels said.
if the ec farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze,
  there would be little incentive for the community to work to
  correct the international trade situation, he added.
samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the ec
  oilseeds regime and an ec regulation concerning meat imports to
  third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the
  u.s. wants to see resolved under the auspices of gatt.

us warns iran, begins escorting tanker convoy
  the united states warned iran again 
  that it was ready to retaliate for any further hostile military
  action in the gulf as u.s. warships began escorting another
  tanker convoy southward from kuwait.
u.s. defense secretary caspar weinberger said the u.s.
  sought no further gulf hostitilies but was ready to deal with
  any iranian response to monday's attack on an iranian oil rig.
several hours later, the pentagon announced that u.s.
  warships had begun escorting two u.s. flag kuwaiti tankers --
  the 80,000 ton product carrier ocean city and 46,000 ton
  liquified petroleum tanker gas king -- southward from kuwait.
the defense department said the 12th such convoy of u.s.
  flagged kuwaiti tankers through the gulf began at 0230 edt
  under the escort by the u.s. guided missile frigate ford.
it
  did not say what oth u.s. warships were in the area.
"it (the convoy) is now progressing uneventfully in the
  central gulf," the pentagon statement said.
asked on nbc's "today" program if the united states was
  prepared for a major war with iran, weinberger said, "well we
  are prepared i think for whatever eventualities emerge from
  this situation but we don't look on it as a war."

lyng defends u.s.
export subsidy program
  u.s. agriculture secretary richard
  lyng said the united states will continue its policy of
  subsidizing farm exports to regain lost markets until there is
  a global agreement to end such subsidies.
in an interview with reuters, lyng also acknowledged he was
  troubled by the prospect that the export enhancement program
  (eep) could prove so indispensable to boosting u.s. exports
  that the u.s. would have difficulty abandoning it.
"yes, i'm troubled with that a little bit," he said.
"there's
  no question about it, the longer you feed the calf on the cow,
  the longer it is to wean it."
in recent months, usda has offered subsidies on a growing
  list of commodities to an increasing number of countries.
lyng called u.s. and european community export subsidies
  "just plain nonsensical as a long-term policy" and said he saw an
  end to the expansion of the eep.
"i'm sure there's an end to the expansion, but we are doing
  this to accomplish our goal which is to regain the markets that
  we've lost, to keep our products competitive and to let those,
  particularly the european community, who, we are convinced, are
  the worst offenders in terms of the export subsidization, that
  we are prepared to continue to do this until we can come to
  some agreement to put an end to it," he said.

soviet 1988 oil output target at 625 mln tonnes
  the soviet oil production target for 1988
  has been set at 625 mln tonnes, a rise of eight mln tonnes over
  this year's planned output.
oil minister vasily dinkov announced the figure on tuesday
  at the supreme soviet, the country's nominal parliament.
he said a new development strategy, fuller use of oil
  deposits and better housing and pay for oilmen had allowed an
  upsurge in the oil industry after three years of stagnation
  which began in late 1983.
last year the soviet union produced 615 mln tonnes of oil,
  slightly short of the target of 616.7 mln.
january-september figures released at the weekend showed
  soviet oil output in the first nine months of this year at 467
  mln tonnes.
the 1987 target is 617 million.
dinkov said the soviet union would develop 38 new oil
  deposits in the coming year.
he called for speedier geolog
  prospecting across the country to spur the oil industry.
the supreme soviet convened on monday to endorse the 1988
  budget and plan.
the session is expected to end on tuesday.

he said in a television interview the dispute had fanned

  between finance ministers of the major nations.
he said the dispute was a row which should not have
  happened and agreed that much of the blame lay with u.s.

baker seen winning german interest rates battle
  the united states appears to have won a
  transatlantic battle by forcing the bundesbank to trim interest
  rates, european economists said.
but they added washington set the stakes high by testing
  the limits of the louvre accord while global stock markets were
  plunging.
west german finance minister gerhard stoltenberg and u.s.
  treasury secretary james baker reaffirmed their commitment to
  currency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in frankfurt,
  according to official statements released late monday.
only 13 hours after the statements were released, the
  bundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banks
  liquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pct
  facility rate offered last week.
while the two ministers were meeting with bundesbank
  president karl otto poehl, the central bank had also added
  money market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want a
  strong rise in the tender allocation rate on tuesday.
"it's round one to the americans, " said richard reid,
  senior european economist for brokers ubs/philips and drew in
  london.
but reid added, "we shouldn't forget that it has taken one
  of the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the west
  germans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05
  percentage point."
over the weekend, criticism by baker of earlier tightening
  of west german monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and
  fuelled speculation that the louvre accord was no longer valid.
six leading industrial nations agreed under february's
  louvre accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary
  policies.
it has since been reaffirmed by the group of seven -
  the us, japan, west germany, britain, france, italy and canada.
the frankfurt meeting on monday soothed currency markets
  and the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading
  in new york.
at the frankfurt fixing on tuesday, the dollar was
  quoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on monday.
guenther aschoff, chief economist at deutsche
  genossenschaftbank in frankfurt said massive declines on world
  stock markets had been the main reason for the fall in west
  german short-term interest rates on tuesday.
"the bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market
  losses... that was the responsible thing to do and if it fits
  with baker's wishes, then all the better," he said.
no central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and the
  bundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises
  in the u.s., aschoff said.
poehl told a conference in frankfurt on tuesday the central
  bank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he
  thought the global rate increase was a cause for concern.
giles keating, economist with credit suisse first boston
  ltd in london said "the cautious bundesbank has beaten a retreat
  and baker has won a battle...but he hasn't won the war as the
  security repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was
  before the imf meeting last month in washington."
before the imf meeting, when the louvre accord was
  reaffirmed, the bundesbank was offering money market liquidity
  at 3.60 pct, keating noted.
economists said the united states now appeared to have
  agreed to play by the rules of the louvre accord and support
  the dollar in return for the german action on interest rates.
any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder
  washington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, stoltenberg
  told a news conference on tuesday.
he added he would not rule
  out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening
  on exchange markets to defend the dollar's value.
deutsche genossenschaftbank's aschoff stressed west
  germany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency
  stability.
in addition, both the u.s. and west german central
  banks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them
  to again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar.

ec agrees trade deal with argentina
  the european community (ec) agreed a
  trade deal with argentina designed to compensate the country
  following the entry of spain and portugal into the group, ec
  officials said.
under the deal agreed by ec foreign ministers, argentina
  will gain additional trading rights on a series of products
  including meat, fish and cereals by-products.
but ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with
  canada and japan and are due to study these again, the
  officials said.
the deal with argentina was agreed by a majority of ec
  states after west germany withdrew objections to increased
  quotas for argentina on high-quality beef.
ireland and france continued to oppose the deal on meat,
  saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals
  substitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, the
  officials said.
under the deal, argentina will benefit from
  improved quotas on exports of beef to the ec.
in particular the
  quota on high-quality hilton beef will be raised by 4,500
  tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will
  be increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.
argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of
  5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced
  levies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.
the improved trade terms were offered after argentina said
  that spain and portugal's entry into the ec affected their
  exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries.
they
  have been negotiated under the rules of gatt (general agreement
  on tariffs and trade).
but officials said ministers had been unable to resolve
  canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to spain had
  been affected by the country's ec membership.
officials said the ec had asked gatt to arbitrate on the
  fish dispute with canada.
ministers also decided to continue talks with japan.
the ec
  claims that spain and portugal's entry into the group has
  improved trade conditions for japan but has been unsatisfied
  with japanese offers of compensation.
japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on
  citrus fruits to aid ec exports, to improve tariffs for some
  other farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwear
  and to offer better trade terms for spain and portugal.
ec external trade commissioner willy de clercq told
  journalists: "we maintain our position that the (japanese)
  concessions were not enough."
"we hope that there will be an improvement," he said.

he said in a television interview that "there is nothing in
  the events of the past few days to increase the upward pressure
  on (u.k.) interest rates."
sterling has so far stayed solid during the crisis, backed
  by strong economic fundamentals and by 10 pct bank base lending
  rates, analysts said.
lawson's comments followed another
  frantic day in london's financial center, where british shares
  closed 12.2 pct down on the day.

west virginia free of two major cattle diseases
  west virginia has been declared free

it said a state is recognized as tuberculosis-free if no

  the state complies with the uniform methods and rules of the
  state-federal cooperative eradication program.
to achieve brucellosis-free status, a state's cattle
  population must remain uninfected for the previous 12 months.
there are 33 states, plus the u.s. virgin islands,
  classified as free of bovine tuberculosis and 24 states, plus
  puerto rico and the u.s. virgin islands, which have eradicated
  brucellosis.
only 20 states and the u.s. virgin islands have
  eradicated both diseases, it noted.
us senate cuts off stall tactics on gulf bill
  confronted by new hostilities
  involving u.s. forces in the gulf, the u.s. senate voted to end
  republican stalling tactics and limit debate on a measure that
  could give congress a larger role in gulf policy.
the measure, however, does not require president reagan to
  comply with the 1973 war powers act as does a related senate
  bill.
the controversial war powers act could require a pullout
  of u.s. forces from the gulf.
the senate voted 67-28 to stop a filibuster and limit
  debate to 30 hours on a bipartisan measure that requires reagan
  to report to congress on gulf policy within 60 days and calls
  for a resolution to be passed in the house and senate on the
  situation in the volatile waterway 30 days later.
the resolution could be about any gulf-related issue,
  including an expression of support or of disapproval for
  reagan's policy of protecting 11 kuwaiti tankers from iran in
  the waterway.
the pentagon said the 12th u.s.-protected convoy
  began moving through the gulf early tuesday.

stoltenberg says criticism not "one-way street"
  finance minister gerhard stoltenberg said he
  was surprised by recent criticism of west german economic
  policies voiced by u.s. treasury secretary james baker but
  added that the criticism was not purely one-sided.
stoltenberg told the west german trade and industry
  association (diht) that before a meeting with baker on monday,
  "there had been surprising notes of criticism (from the united
  states)."
he added.
"criticism is not a one-way street."
he did not elaborate, but bonn has often called on the u.s.
  to reduce its federal budget deficit.
over the weekend baker had criticised west german economic
  policies, saying that rises in domestic interest rates here
  were not in the spirit of last february's louvre pact to
  stabilise currencies.
stoltenberg told the diht that his meeting on monday with
  baker had resolved differences between the two countries.
at a news conference earlier on tuesday stoltenberg had
  declined to comment specifically on baker's criticisms, but he
  had said that after three hours of discussions on monday, "one
  remark or another has been clarified."
us ruled out attack on iranian silkworms
  u.s. military planners ruled out
  iran's silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attack
  mounted on monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into the
  iran-iraq war, defense and middle east experts said.
u.s. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform and
  raided another in what the administration called a "measured and
  appropriate response" to an iranian silkworm missile attack last
  friday on a u.s.-flagged tanker in kuwaiti waters.
private analysts generally agreed that going after the rig
  rather than an onshore economic or military target such as
  silkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by washington to
  limit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both at
  home and in the gulf.
"it simply demonstrated the united states will take military
  action when they (iran) take military action," norman polmar, a
  defense analyst and author, said.
he said hitting the platforms had spared iran the
  embarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoiding
  an escalating spiral of attack and counterattack.
in addition, it minimized the risk to u.s. forces and the
  potential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft that
  could have been shot down had they taken part in an attack.
anthony cordesman, author of a new book on the iran-iraq
  war, said the united states apparently chose a limited target
  to keep alive the possibility that u.n. secretary general
  javier perez de cuellar might still persuade iran to accept a
  security council call for a ceasefire.
"we want the u.n. peace initiative to work if there's any
  chance at all," he said, adding that the action made it clear
  tougher steps would follow if iran to attack gulf shipping.
in targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the pentagon
  to have been turned into a military command post -- washington
  also sent a message that it might be willing to attack iran's
  economic lifeline.
pentagon officials said the platform had
  been used as a base for iranian raids against shipping in the
  lower gulf.
"we have chosen a military target, but we also have shown
  iran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting
  capabilities," cordesman said.
he predicted the united states would respond to any future
  major iranian challenges by hitting iran's naval base at bandar
  abbas on the straits of hormuz, followed by mining the
  approaches to iran's oil export terminal on kharg island.
defense secretary caspar weinberger said on monday the
  united states did not seek further confrontation with iran, "but
  we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action
  by iran with stronger countermeasures."

spain appeals for ec help on maize imports
  spanish farm minister carlos romero,
  speaking at a meeting of ec farm ministers, called for action
  to help the spanish maize market, spanish diplomatic sources
  said.
spain is threatened with massive imports from third
  countries by the end of the year, they said.
they said the imports are due to come in as a result of the
  accord by which the ec has promised the united states it will
  import two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum
  into spain from third countries this year.
around a sixth of this tonnage has so far come in under a
  reduced levy system and the ec cereals management committee may
  decide this week to authorise the spanish intervention board to
  make direct purchases.
the sources said romero urged that other ec countries
  should take some of the imports to prevent disturbance of the
  spanish market.
they said he threatened to withhold support for the ec
  commission plan for new limits on farm output which if breached
  would mean price cuts unless spain received some help.
the sources said no direct reply was given to romero at the
  meeting.

saudi role in gulf praised by u.s. officials
  saudi arabian crown prince abdullah
  bin abdul aziz was thanked by the reagan administration for his
  country's close, and closed-mouthed, cooperation with
  washington in the gulf, a senior u.s. official said.
"the saudis are being very cooperative.
it would be nice if
  the saudis would go more public, but it's their real estate,"
  said the official who asked not to be named.
he declined to describe what sort of help the saudis were
  providing, saying that saudi officials are reluctant to
  acknowledge their role in the gulf where the united states has
  stationed forces to protect shipping lanes.
the prince met vice president george bush on monday after
  u.s. naval forces attacked offshore iranian oil platforms in
  what washington said was retaliation for an iranian attack on a
  ship moored off kuwait and flying the u.s. flag.
asked at the start of the meeting how he felt about the
  attack, the prince, who is here on an official visit, replied,
  "i believe what the united states has done is their
  responsibility as a superpower."

bank of new york reaffirms terms for irving &lt;v>
  the bank of new york corp &lt;bk> said it
  reaffirmed the terms of its offer for irving bank corp despite
  the drop in the bank of new york's share price to 30-1/8, a
  bank of new york spokesman said.
"the offer still stands, we have not changed our offer," a
  bank of new york spokesman said.
irving would not comment on how the drop in the market
  affects its position on the bid or whether it would buy back
  any of its own shares.
earlier this month, irving rejected the bid as inadequate
  and said it wanted to retain its independence.
in late september, bank of new york offered 80 dlrs per
  share in cash for 47.4 pct of irving.
for the remaining 52.6
  pct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for one
  irving share.
at that time, the stock purchase portion was worth close to
  80 dlrs per share, but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs per
  share for a net price of 68 dlrs, one analyst said.
according to the prospectus offer, shareholders may tender
  for all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis.
analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop would
  affect the acquisition.
"if it gets to the irving shareholders, they would approve
  it, but irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,"
  said mark alpert, banking analyst with bear stearns cos inc.
      "and the market is saying the deal won't go through,"
  alpert said.
"the transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed at
  present.
if irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs a
  share, then they won't go at a lower price," another analyst
  said.
the analyst also doubted that bank of new york could afford
  to retain its original offer.
however, industry sources were more uncertain about
  prospects for the deal.
"with irving's price so low, bank of new york's offer will
  look good to irving shareholders," said michael flores, a
  consultant at bank earnings international, a consulting firm.
the drop of irving's share to 44 dlrs per share, which is
  about a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increases
  the chance that bank of new york will succeed, flores said.
analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likely
  to depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the banking
  industry.
"bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't use
  their own stock to make acquisitions because their share price
  is too depressed," alpert said.
since only banks can buy another bank, the only other
  possible acquirors would be a foreign bank, alpert said.
"in the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobbered
  more than the acquirees," another analyst said.

us diplomatic missions on high alert over gulf
  the state department says many u.s.
  diplomatic missions overseas are on high alert for possible
  retaliation from iran for monday's attack on two iranian oil
  platforms by american forces in the gulf.
at the same time, the pentagon announced on tuesday that
  u.s. forces have begun escorting another kuwaiti tanker convoy
  southward through the gulf from kuwait.
the state department renewed its warning to americans not
  to travel to iran because of what spokeswoman phyllis oakley
  called, "its virulent anti-american policies and support for
  terrorism."
"the threat to americans has increased significantly," she
  said in announcing that the department was reiterating advice
  it last made in january.
the department said about 2,600
  american citizens live in iran, the overwhelming majority dual
  nationalities.
oakley said no specific warning has been issued to u.s.
  diplomats and americans living abroad in the aftermath of the
  u.s. attack on the oil drilling platforms, but "many of our
  missions are on a high state of alert."
brazil's sept trade surplus highest of the year
  brazil's september trade surplus
  was the best so far this year, totalling 1.494 billion dlrs,
  compared with 1.434 billion dlrs in august and 540 mln dlrs in
  september last year, banco do brasil's foreign trade department
  (cacex) director namir salek said in a news conference.
september exports were 2.694 billion dlrs, slightly down
  from 2.76 billion dlrs in august.
imports in september amounted
  to 1.2 billion dlrs, against 1.32 billion dlrs in august.
salek said the accumulated surplus in the jan-sept period
  was 7.857 billion dlrs, compared with 8.667 billion dlrs in a
  similar 1986 period.
coffee accounted with 320 mln dlrs of exports, up from 222
  mln dlrs in august and 212 mln in september 1986, salek said.
the cacex director said he expected the country's trade
  surplus to average 800 mln dlrs in the remaining three months
  of the year, estimating the year's overall surplus to reach
  10.2 billion dlrs, from 25.6 billion dlrs worth of exports and
  15.4 billion dlrs of imports.
he attributed the good surplus on exports of manufactured
  and semimanufactured goods.
he mentioned car exports, which
  accounted alone with sales of 617 mln dlrs in the jan-sept
  period, against 194 mln dlrs in a similar 1986 period.

canada panel advises cutting u.s. corn duty
  the canadian import tribunal said the
  countervailing duty on u.s. corn imports should be cut to 30
  canadian cts a bushel from 1.10 dlrs a bushel.
in a report to the canadian finance department, the
  tribunal said the duty is hurting canadian farmers and food
  processors.
the duty was imposed last year after the revenue
  department found u.s. corn production was subsidized.
it is now up to the government to decide whether to change
  the duty.
treasury's baker under fire for wall street drop
  as official washington sought to
  restore investor confidence after monday's wall street
  collapse, treasury secretary james baker came under fire from
  critics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis.
baker's weekend blast at the west german bundesbank for
  boosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of an
  international accord to stabilize currency values.
nigel lawson, british chancellor of the exchequer, was
  among those who said the treasury secretary's statements helped
  spur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investors
  think that a clash between the two major economic powers would
  damage the world economy.
lawson told a london television interviewer tuesday, "i
  think the scale of the (stock) fall was very great.
that, i
  think, was partly due to statements that have been made by
  senior figures on the other side of the atlantic."
it was a
  dispute that should never have happened, he added.
although baker appeared to patch over the rift at a
  hastily-called meeting with west german officials monday, he  
  still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the united
  states on tuesday.
baker cut short a long-planned trip to
  scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis.
said one u.s. analyst of baker's weekend remarks, "his
  timing could not have been worse."
one government bond salesman in new york said, "he actually
  thought that yelling at the germans, and threatening to smack
  the dollar down would work.
that doesn't show much
  understanding of international monetary gamesmanship."
however, some analysts said west germany's stubborn march
  toward higher interest rates may have forced baker's hand.
"on the surface baker may look responsible for this, but if
  you go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financial
  markets), it was west german policy," said robert brusca of
  nikko securities international in new york.
"all mr. baker did was to mention the obvious in public, so
  making him responsible for it was a little like killing the
  messenger," he said.
after monday's talks, the u.s. and west german governments
  made it clear that the louvre currency accord, pieced together
  in paris in february, was still in effect.
wall street feared that collapse of the agreement might be
  a prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar to
  the late 1970s.
analysts believe monday's wall street crash
  wiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values.
treasury sources said that baker, already unhappy about
  bonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the
  global recovery moving, was angered by a bundesbank interest
  rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite.
he felt that the u.s. recovery, inching along in its 59th
  month, could no longer be the only engine of global economic
  expansion.
a growing u.s. economy has been serving as a huge
  market for debtor country exports.
moreover, baker, the consummate politician, was worried
  that the republican party might face next year's presidential
  election with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badly
  tarnished.
a rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt
  crisis and completely choke off u.s. economic growth that has
  already slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate.
"there's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the
  economy, and it's important that the psychology turn around
  quickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, and
  eventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically,"
  former deputy treasury secretary richard darman said in a
  television interview.
in many ways, the official response was mild.
washington was stunned by the sudden wall street retreat,
  with president reagan speaking for most people by admitting
  that he was "puzzled."
u.s. government sources said the secretary immediately
  returned to the treasury to be briefed on market developments
  and, presumably, their political impact.
for all of this, it seems unlikely that baker's status in
  washington will diminish because of the market fall.
asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll because
  of the wall street retreat, texas democratic senator lloyd
  bentsen said with some irony, "oh, i think it's much too late to
  be doing that...you have an administration that's taken the
  attitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and ---
  retire to the living room to take a nap.
you just can't do
  that."

reagan sees room for interest rate declines

reagan's statement followed a meeting with his top economic

dart group drops dayton hudson &lt;dh> takeover bid
  dart group corp &lt;darta.o> affiliate
  madison partners said that given current market conditions it
  has dropped its takeover bid for dayton hudson corp.
the company said it sold 1.4 mln of its 4.6 mln shares of
  dayton hudson stock.
it said it intends to sell the rest of its dayton hudson
  shares.
at current market levels, it would suffer a 70 mln dlr
  aftertax loss on its holding, a spokesman said.
dart said it will not solicit authorization to call a
  meeting of dayton hudson shareholders.
dart had offered to buy dayton hudson for 68 dlrs per
  share, valuing the minneapolis based retailer at 6.6 billion
  dlrs.
that offer was rejected by the company.
following the selloff in takeover stocks last week, and the
  market's decline this week, dayton hudson stock closed at
  27-1/2 today, off 2-1/2.
dart's holdings amounted to just under five pct of dayton
  hudson.
a dart spokesman said the 1.4 mln shares were sold in the
  market today.
convoy runs gulf gauntlet, other ships stay clear
  a new convoy of tankers escorted by
  american warships headed down the gulf on wednesday, towards
  iranian oil platforms still oozing smoke after having being
  blasted by u.s. navy raiders.
some gulf sea captains were reported to be steering well
  clear of iran's silkworm missiles, however, and frontline
  emirate kuwait redeployed air defences to counter the threat.
"i think the predominant feeling ... is of being scared this
  conflict will escalate," a top west german foreign ministry
  official, helmut schaefer, told reporters in bahrain after a
  tour of three gulf states.
b
      shipping sources said on tuesday night at least six sea
  captains had voiced fears that iran would avenge monday's u.s.
  raids by unleashing more silkworm missiles at ships plying the
  gulf.
belgium decided two minesweepers en route for the gulf
  would stay out for the time being following monday's u.s.
  action.
but there was no sign that the prospect of more tit-for-tat
  assaults had reduced the level of shipping activity in the
  area.
iran, having vowed to react strongly after monday's u.s.
  action, launched a barrage of threats and ridicule.
for its part, washington warned iran again on tuesday that
  it was ready for any further hostile action.
pentagon officials then announced that a u.s.
guided
  missile destroyer began escorting two kuwaiti tankers flying
  the u.s. flag southwards--the 80,000 tonne product carrier
  ocean city and 46,000 tonne petroleum tanker gas king.

artillery shells said to fall on kuwait border
  artillery shells from an exchange of fire
  between iran and iraq fell on kuwait's northern border on
  tuesday but caused no casualties, the kuwait news agency kuna
  said, quoting a defense ministry official.
there were rumors in world oil markets on tuesday that iran
  had fired shells at an oil camp in northern kuwait in
  retaliation for u.s.
attacks on iranian oil platforms in the
  gulf on monday.
"several shells fell in a random manner on the
  northern border of the country," the official told kuna.
"it
  seems these shells arose from an exchange of fire between iran
  and iraq... no one was wounded and there were no losses."
diplomats said shells from the nearby iran-iraq warfront
  had in the past fallen in the northern kuwaiti desert.
a senior kuwait petroleum corporation official had earlier
  told reuters he was unaware of any attack against kuwaiti oil
  installations.

u.s. may end additional sanctions against japan
  the united states may lift an
  additional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against japan later
  this month, reagan administration officials said.
president reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions on
  japanese goods last april for its failure to honor a 1986
  agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the u.s. and third
  country markets and to open its home market to u.s. goods.
the move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct on
  japanese color television sets, hand-held power tools and
  portable computers.
reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last june  after
  japan ended selling the semiconductors on the u.s. market at
  below production costs.
semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memory
  and recall purposes in a wide variety of computers.
the administration officials said commerce department 
  monitors showed that japan was ending its dumping of the
  semiconductors in third countries, where they had been taking
  sales away from american-made semiconductors.
they said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions would
  be lifted by the end of the month.
the united states and japan remain at odds over opening the
  closed japanese markets to u.s. goods.
u.s. and japanese officials reviewed japan's compliance
  with the agreement earlier this week.
the periodic reviews are to continue and the remaining
  sanctions to stay in force, the officials said, until japan is
  in full compliance with the semiconductor agreement.

the plant, which has
  been grown in southern texas, reaches a height of 10 feet in
  three months and is said to produce better quality newsprint
  than wood pulp, a cip official said.
slenniken said the company has commissioned studies for a
  200,000 tonne capacity pulp mill which would use the fibre but
  would need partners to begin the project.
"we are not yet ready to commit the hundreds of millions of
  dollars it would take for such a project," slenniken said.
he said cip has been using the pulp on a trial basis to
  make newsprint containing 90 pct kenaf fibre and 10 pct
  softwood fibre at its trois-rivieres, quebec plant.
cip, canada's second largest newsprint producer, recently
  launched a 366 mln canadian dlr newsprint mill at gold river,
  british columbia which is due begin producing 230,000 metric
  tonnes per year by fall of 1989.

southland &lt;slc> targeted in sec investigation
  southland corp said it was told the

"southland has been advised that the commission has issued
  a private order of investigation concerning the trading of
  southland stock during various times in 1987 and the issuance
  of various public statements by southland," southland said in a
  proxy statement to shareholders.
southland did not elaborate on the sec order of
  investigation, and company officials could not be reached for
  comment late tuesday.
the sec has a long-standing policy against confirming or
  denying the existence of investigations.
the proxy statement, filed with the securities and exchange
  commission, is required for a november 5 shareholders meeting
  called to approve the previously announced acquisition of
  southland by a company controlled by southland chairman john
  thompson and members of his family.
earlier this year, a group led by thompson acquired
  majority ownership of southland through a 77 dlrs a share
  tender offer for 31.5 mln shares of southland common stock.
if the merger is approved, common stock still outstanding
  will be converted into the right to receive 61.32 dlrs a share

senate backs u.s.
retaliation in gulf
  the u.s. senate on tuesday backed
  president reagan's retaliatory strike against iranian targets
  in the gulf as it moved to take a greater role in making policy
  in the volatile region.
senators voted 92-1 for a non-binding measure that endorsed
  monday's u.s. attack on two iranian oil platforms in
  retaliation for an iranian attack last friday on a kuwaiti ship
  flying the american flag.
the measure said the attack was a firm indication of u.s.
  resolve that iran "cannot take military action against the
  united states with impunity."
earlier, the senate cut off republican stalling tactics and
  set a vote on a measure that could give congress a larger role
  in making gulf policy.
the measure, however, does not require
  reagan to comply with the 1973 war powers act, which could lead
  to a pullout of u.s. forces from the gulf.
while democrats and republicans praised the u.s.
  retaliatory strike, many voiced new fears about the growing
  u.s. involvement in the gulf and some demanded that reagan
  comply with the war powers act.
canada seeks five year farm reform plan
  canada will propose at the new round of
  international trade talks that most trade-distorting farm
  subsidies be phased out over a five year period, trade minister
  pat carney said.
"agricultural subsidies and trade barriers have created a
  vicious circle which continues to cause problems of
  overproduction and low commodity prices," carney told the house
  of commons.
carney was outlining the government's new position on the
  farm trade problem that was tabled on tuesday in geneva in the
  multilateral talks under the gatt (general agreement on tariffs
  and trade).
while few details were released, carney said the government
  would also be pressing for an improvement in market access and
  new measures to ensure countries do not erect artificial
  barriers.
"under the canadian proposal, all countries would have to
  ensure that domestic policies and programs to address the
  specific needs of their farm sectors do not distort trade," a
  government background paper said.
"furthermore, in assessing the trade impact of programs,
  credit could be given to countries which effectively control
  the output of farm products," the papers said.

us says canadian, israeli pacts should spur trade
  trade representative clayton yeutter
  said on monday that the u.s. free trade agreements with canada
  and israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing the
  global trading system.
he said the canadian and israeli pacts will not set back
  worldwide reform efforts under the general agreement on tariffs
  and trade (gatt) as some critics feared but help them.
the gatt talks began a year ago in punta del este, uruguay
  to liberalize the global trading system and to include in it
  trade in agriculture and services such as banking.
yeutter made his remarks at a u.s.-israeli trade meeting
  marking the second year of their bilateral accord.
the
  canadian-u.s. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yet
  been approved by the u.s. congress and canadian parliament.
the two free trade agreements (fta) would gradually remove
  tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and
  many services.
yeutter said in the aftermath of the canadian and israeli
  pacts "other countries have realized that if they want to
  continue to have access to the world's largest market, they had
  better get serious about improving the gatt."
the pact with israel, he said, is gradually increasing
  shipments both ways and the canadian pact will substantially
  increase the gross national products in both countries.
yeutter also said the canadian and israeli pacts should
  serve as important precedents for progress in gatt.
yeutter said, "increasing trade is one of the keys to
  enhanced political and economic stability around the globe."
he said, "a stronger gatt will enhance prosperity, not only
  for advanced industrial nations, but also for other countries
  that need to increase trade in order to better their standards
  of living."
yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress
  made in the israeli and canadian trade pacts by resorting to
  protectionism.
he was referring to trade legislation pending in congress
  that would force the united states to take retaliatory actions
  against nations with large trade surpluses with the united
  states if the countries practiced unfair trade.
the legislation was prompted by a growing u.s. trade
  deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still
  rising.
yeutter said the pressures for congress to act were hard to
  resist, but the pending legislation would undermine president
  reagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade.
yeutter renewed the threat of a white house veto.
he said, "president reagan will veto any bill that contains
  serious flaws, and i believe that veto would be sustained."
baker/stoltenberg meeting soothes markets
  news of a meeting between u.s. treasury
  secretary james baker and west german finance minister gerhard
  stoltenberg on monday soothed currency markets, allowing the
  dollar to recoup much of the day's losses, dealers said.
news of the meeting, which took place in frankfurt in great
  secrecy, came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism by
  baker of west german monetary policy, which had provoked fears
  that the louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy.
the dollar reacted immediately to the news, rising over two
  pfennigs in after hours new york trading, dealers there said.
the announcement of the meeting, also attended by
  bundesbank president karl otto poehl, was made simultaneously
  in bonn and washington, timed for after the closure of new york
  markets.
baker, stoltenberg and poehl agreed to pursue the policies
  accepted under the february louvre accord, a finance ministry
  spokesman in bonn said.
the dollar rose to 1.7970/90 marks from new york's close of
  1.7730/40.
it had closed there on friday at 1.7975/85 marks.
the dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market
  reacted to baker's criticism of rising west german interest
  rates, and stock markets crashed worldwide.
baker had said that
  west germany was apparently breaching the louvre accord.
under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged to
  coordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, with
  the surplus countries, west germany and japan, stimulating
  their economies and the u.s. promising to cut its budget
  deficit.
west german government sources said rising west german
  money market rates could not be seen as a breach of the louvre
  pact.
they were rather a direct reaction to higher interest
  rates in the united states.
u.s.
bond yields have been rising
  since may on inflationary fears and in early september the fed
  raised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50.
german yields have also risen over this period, but less
  markedly, and since late september the bundesbank has nudged up
  short-term rates by changing the terms on its security
  repurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering the
  money market.
the allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,
  compared with 3.60 pct.
this was partly due to west germany's
  inability to uncouple itself from u.s. interest rate trends,
  but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the
  bundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary
  growth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,
  bank economists said.
this monetary tightening reflected a switch from the
  pragmatic line pursued by bundesbank president karl otto poehl
  since early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to the
  more cautious approach of vice president helmut schlesinger.
in an apparent gesture to baker, coinciding with his visit,
  the bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this
  morning.
dealers said this was clearly a move to appease u.s.
  anger over the most recent west german interest rate rises.
"they (the bundesbank) just don't want to come too much
  under american fire," said chris zwermann, currency adviser at
  swiss bank corp here.
"it seems to me that this is the bundesbank beating quite a
  significant retreat from its position," added giles keating,
  economist at credit suisse first boston ltd in london.
the significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of
  the bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pact
  on tuesday, and its result on wednesday, money market
  economists said.
today's injection of liquidity shows that the bundesbank
  does not want a further strong rise in the tender allocation
  rate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,
  little changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility.
the bundesbank and finance ministry had given no indication
  that the meeting would take place, although the finance
  ministry spokesman said it had been arranged last week.
earlier on monday the finance ministry spokesman, asked to
  comment on the apparent u.s.-german clash over the louvre
  accord, went no further than quoting stoltenberg as saying he
  assumed monetary cooperation would continue.
the spokesman said he believed baker had already left west
  germany for sweden on monday.
this week he is also due to visit
  denmark and belgium.
ex-arco &lt;arc> chief sees energy crisis by 1990
  dwindling global crude oil reserves and
  the lack of any major new discoveries in recent years will send
  the world into an energy crisis by 1990, the former atlantic
  richfield co chairman robert o. anderson said.
"it's going to come sooner than anyone thinks," anderson
  told reporters after addressing a houston business lunch.
"i
  believe we're going to see a change in the world oil markets in
  two to three years because oil is becoming harder to find."
anderson, who retired from arco last year to form hondo oil
  and gas co, said world oil consumption is approaching 60 mln
  barrels a day but a current excess capacity cushion of about
  4.5 mln barrels a day will rapidly disappear.
"if you looked around the world, you could not scrape up
  one mln barrels a day in shut-in production outside the middle
  east," he said.
"we're soon going to be right back where we
  were in 1973 and 1979."
anderson predicted that world oil prices would end 1987 at
  about 24 dlrs a barrel and continue a gradual climb.
"there's no way prices can stay flat because there isn't
  enough supply," he said.
"there have been no major oil
  discoveries for the past 15 to 20 years."
alaska's prudhoe bay oil reserves, the last major world
  discovery, has already produced about five billion barrels of
  oil or more than half of its estimated reserves, he said.
venezuela backs increase in ecuador opec quota
  venezuela will back ecuador's bid to
  raise its opec quota above 221,000 barrels per day (bpd)
  because it is a justifiable demand, venezuelan energy minister
  arturo hernandez grisanti said on monday.
he told reporters the country deserved a higher quota in
  compensation for the five months it was forced to suspend oil
  production when its main pipeline was destroyed by an
  earthquake last march.
"for this five-month period, ecuador did not exercise its
  right to produce 221,000 bpd," he said.
"we should recognize
  ecuador's right to increase its quota ...
there is a basis of
  justice in that country's petition."
he added however, the quota increase should be gradual to
  avoid harming the market, he added.
hernandez grisanti said he understood ecuador would
  formally submit the request for a higher quota at the next
  ministerial conference of the organization of petroleum
  exporting countries (opec) opening december 9 in vienna.

u.s., at u.n., claims self-defense for gulf attack
  the united states invoked the right
  of self-defense in destroying an iranian oil platform in the
  gulf, the american delegation told the united nations.
lieutenant general vernon walters sent letters about the
  incident to security council president maurizio bucci, the
  delegate of italy, and secretary general javier perez de
  cuellar.
u.n. press secretary francois giuliani said the secretary
  general had no comment on the attack, which followed his appeal
  last friday for restraint in the crisis while he pursued
  efforts to obtain a ceasefire between iran and iraq.
in his explanation, walters said the united states took
  defensive action in response to an iranian attack against
  american ships in the gulf.
he cited an iranian silkworm missile strike last friday in
  kuwait waters against the united states-flag ship sea isle
  city.
walters said that military forces on the destroyed iranian
  platform had engaged in a variety of actions against united
  states-flag and other nonbelligerent vessels and planes.
"in accordance with article 51 of the united nations
  (charter), i wish, on behalf of my government, to report that
  united states forces have exercised the inherent right of
  self-defense under internation law by taking defensive action
  in response to attacks by .
.
.
iran against united states
  vessels in the gulf," walters said.
members of the security council met behind closed doors on
  monday to discuss developments in the gulf war, but no
  statement was issued afterwards.
france says u.s. had right to strike
  france voiced its comprehension for a u.s.
attack on an iranian target while calling for a swift halt to
  the gulf war to avoid further escalation.
"the french authorities reaffirm their attachment to the
  freedom and security of navigation and to the right of all
  states to take action under international law and the united
  nations charter to halt attacks such as that of october 16," the
  foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement.
the united states said its forces destroyed an iranian oil
  platform in the gulf and struck at a second on monday in
  retaliation for a recent iranian missile attack on a
  u.s.-flagged kuwaiti ship.
washington said the platforms were used to monitor shipping
  and to launch small-boat attacks on shipping.
the french
  statement described the target as "an iranian military platform."
but the french statement added that "everything must be done
  now to avoid that these military developments lead to a new
  escalation of the conflict."

u.s.
lawmakers support gulf action
  american lawmakers rallied behind
  president reagan for the u.s. strike against iranian targets in
  the gulf but the attack fueled a sharp new white house-congress
  debate over limits on his powers to make war.
the pentagon announced on monday that u.s. warships
  destroyed a non-producing oil platform used for monitoring gulf
  ship traffic and military operations, and also raided a second
  iranian oil rig in retaliation for an earlier iranian attack on
  a kuwaiti ship flying the american flag.
many democrats, who control congress, and republicans
  expressed support for the attack and praised it as an
  appropriate "measured response."
but democrats and liberal republicans voiced new fears that
  the growing confrontation between tehran and the united states
  could erupt into a major war, and demanded that reagan comply
  with the 1973 war powers act, which could lead to a pullout of
  american forces from the waterway.
"those who contend the strike was necessary must realize
  their words are easily construed as a tacit endorsement of war
  with iran," said sen mark hatfield of oregon, a republican.
lawson welcomes reaffirmation of louvre accord
  u.k. chancellor of the exchequer nigel
  lawson welcomed on monday the reaffirmation by the u.s. and

  increasing key interest rates, saying they were not in line

italy worried at rising tension after gulf attack
  italian prime minister giovanni goria told
  the cabinet on monday he was worried about the increased
  tension in the gulf, but said america's retaliation against
  iran had been limited.
a statement issued after a cabinet meeting said goria had
  been informed by the united states that it would take action
  against an iranian target in the gulf, but had not known
  beforehand that the action would involve an attack on an oil
  platform.
"the prime minister expressed his concern over the possible
  consequences of increased tension in the gulf, at the same time
  recognizing the limited character of the american military
  reaction to the attacks it has suffered in the past few days,"
  the statement said.
goria said italy's own ships were far from the platform at
  the time of the attack and the fleet had been advised to follow
  events with caution.
italy has sent eight ships, including three frigates and
  three minesweepers, to the gulf to protect italian merchant
  shipping there.

bonn confident of maintaining currency stability
  u.s. treasury secretary james baker met west
  german finance minister gerhard stoltenberg and bundesbank
  president karl otto poehl in frankfurt on monday, a bonn
  finance ministry spokesman said.
after the meeting the spokesman quoted stoltenberg as
  saying he was confident that foreign currencies could be
  stabilised at around current levels.
the meeting came after baker criticised west germany for
  increasing short-term money market interest rates.
he had said
  the rise was not in line with the spirit of the louvre accord
  aimed at stabilizing the u.s. dollar last february.
the meeting had been arranged last week, the spokesman
  said.
baker, stoltenberg and poehl had agreed to pursue the
  policies agreed under the louvre pact with reference to
  currency stability and monetary policy.
earlier on monday the bundesbnak injected liquidity into
  the west german money market in a move which money market
  dealers interpreted as an attempt by the west german monetary
  authority to curb interest rate rises.
the spokesman described monday's talks, which he called
  private, as very positive.

us tropical oil labeling plan suffers defeat
  a proposal to require imported
  tropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrow
  and possibly debilitating defeat in the u.s. senate.
the senate agriculture committee rejected the proposal by a
  10-8 vote, virtually snuffing out u.s. soybean producers' hopes
  the plan would be adopted this year.
a similar proposal has made no headway in the house.
sen. tom harkin (d-iowa) offered the proposal as an
  amendment to a farm spending reduction package.
"i don't see this as a trade issue.
i see it as giving
  american consumers the information they need," he said.
proponents of the measure, including the american soybean
  association, have claimed palm, palm kernel and coconut oils
  are high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease.
the u.s. soybean industry believes labels indicating
  tropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourage
  consumption of the oils, imported primarily from malaysia,
  indonesia and the philippines.
but sen. richard lugar (r-ind.)
read a letter from u.s.
  trade representative clayton yeutter, who said the proposal
  "blatantly discriminates" against imports, would be impossible to
  defend under international trade law and would harm relations
  with the philippines, malaysia and indonesia.
yeutter's letter also said americans derive most of their
  saturated fats from meat and dairy products and relatively
  little from tropical oils.
the committee voted largely along party lines, with three
  democrats joining seven republicans to oppose the measure.

delors calls for g-7 meeting
  european community commission
  president jacques delors called for a swift convening of a
  meeting of the g-7 countries following the instability in
  today's trading on world money and stock markets.
he told a press conference here: "g-7 should meet discreetly
  and quickly."
delors said if the dollar were to fall further against the
  mark to levels around 1.60, the european monetary system would
  undergo a "test by fire."
delors said the current problems in the markets had been
  caused by excessive growth in financial trading, excessive
  deregulation and the failure of the fundamentals of the world
  economy to adapt themselves quickly enough to changing
  circumstances.
he said it was "profoundly unjust" to blame it on recent
  increases in west germany.
u.s. treasury's baker meets west german minister
  u.s. treasury secretary james baker
  met west german finance minister gerhard stoltenberg and
  bundesbank president karl otto poehl today in west germany and
  agreed to support the louvre pact, the treasury department
  said.
the treasury described the meeting as "a very positive,
  private meeting in frankfurt, west germany which had been
  agreed upon last week.
"the parties agreed to continue economic
  cooperation under the louvre agreement and its flexible
  application including cooperation on exchange rate stability
  and monetary policies," the treasury said.
the treasury said baker and stoltenberg "are consulting with
  their g-7 colleagues and are confident that this will enable
  them to foster exchange rate stability around current levels."
the louvre pact is an agreement between the group of seven
  leading industrial countries including the united states and
  west germany to promote currency stability.
baker was scheduled to visit scandinavia and belgium this
  week and the department earlier refused to release details of
  his travel itinerary, citing security considerations.

u.s. military leader predicts iranian response
  william crowe, chairman of the u.s.
  joint chiefs of staff, predicted iran will retaliate for the
  u.s. strike against its oil platform though he said iranian
  options were limited.
"they will be determined.
they will not be easily deterred,
  and let me stress for you that our commitment there is not
  going to be risk free or casualty free."
he said the most likely iranian response would involve
  terrorism or the laying of mines.
"they obviously will look for ways that are probably more in
  line with the 'silent hand' than what they have tried thus far,"
  crowe told an american stock exchange conference.
he declined comment on a reporter's query whether he
  favored a stronger move against iran than that ordered by the
  president.
"we carried out the operation that was decided upon and we
  carried it out with enthusiasm and i think it was
  professionally and well done," crowe said.

u.s.
forces destroyed oil rig, raided another
  u.s. warships destroyed an iranian oil
  platform in the gulf on monday and the navy also raided a
  second oil rig in retaliation for friday's iranian missile
  attack on a u.s. flag tanker, the pentagon said.
president reagan and defense secretary caspar weinberger
  warned iran of even stronger countermeasures if the military
  escalation between the two countries continued in the volatile
  waterway.
reagan said he ordered the strike on the first platform by
  four u.s. destroyers, which fired about 1,000 five-inch shells
  at the rostam oil rig 120 miles east of bahrain in the central
  gulf.
a short time later, navy personnel boarded a second iranian
  oil platform about five miles to the north and destroyed radar
  and communications equipment before leaving the structure, the
  pentagon said.
defense department spokesman fred hoffman told reporters
  that the second platform had been abandoned by iranian
  personnel during the shelling and destruction of the first rig.
the united states said both platforms were being used to
  keep track of gulf merchant shipping and to launch speedboat
  attacks on such shipping by iranian revolutionary guards.
gulf and western &lt;gw> to acquire british company
  gulf and western inc's publishing unit,
  simon and schuster, said it agreed in principle to acquire
  &lt;woodhead-faulkner (publishers) ltd>, a british-based publisher

upon completion of the proposed transaction,
  woodhead-faulkner will become part of simon and schuster's
  international group, which in the u.k. includes simon and
  schuster trade books, and prentice hall academic texts.
simon and schuster said that woodhead-faulkner will
  continue to publish under that name.
the company will continue to be under the direction of
  martin woodhead, who will report to henry hirschberg, president
  of simon and schuster's international group.

ec, u.s. plan high-level trade talks
  the european community is willing to
  offer limited concessions to the united states on one of two
  major issues which threaten to poison their trade relations
  next year, an ec commission spokesman said.
he said the offer would be made at a meeting later this
  month between u.s. trade representative clayton yeutter and ec
  external relations commissioner willy de clercq.
ec farm commissioner frans andriessen told agriculture
  ministers meeting in luxembourg that the ec is willing to make
  some temporary arrangements to lighten the impact on u.s.
  exports of an ec plan to ban the sales of meat from animals fed
  with growth hormones, the spokesman said.
washington has said it will take trade reprisals if the ec
  proceeds with the ban from january 1 and if european countries
  do not quickly cut back what it sees as unfair subsidies to the
  makers of their airbus airliner which are harming u.s.
  manufacturers.
it claims the hormones ban has no scientific basis and will
  rob it of 130 mln dlrs' worth of exports a year.
diplomatic sources said the yeutter-de clercq meeting will
  take place in london and will also involve the aerospace
  ministers of france, britain, west germany and spain, the
  countries involved in the airbus project.
britain backs u.s. strike on iran oil platform
  british foreign secretary sir geoffrey
  howe backed the united states' attack on an iranian oil
  platform on monday and said it should not worsen the gulf
  crisis.
"the united states is fully entitled to take military action
  in exercise of rights of self-defense, in the face of the
  imminent threat of further attacks," howe said in a statement
  issued in london.
the united states said its forces destroyed the platform on
  monday in retaliation for an iranian missile attack on a u.s.-
  flagged kuwaiti ship last friday.
referring to that attack, howe added, "i trust the iranians
  will fully understand that continued attacks of this kind will
  only enhance justification for firm action in self-defense."
at a press conferenced in luxembourg during a meeting of
  european community (ec) ministers, howe was asked about
  statements from a senior iranian official who said america was
  now involved in a full-scale war.
"it would be profoundly undesirable and quite unjustified
  for iran to react in that way," he said.

huge oil platforms dot gulf like beacons
  huge oil platforms dot the gulf like
  beacons -- usually lit up like christmas trees at night.
one of them, sitting astride the rostam offshore oilfield,
  was all but blown out of the water by u.s.
warships on monday.
the iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel and
  concrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60
  metres) above the warm waters of the gulf until four u.s.
  destroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it.
the u.s. defense department said just 10 pct of one section
  of the structure remained.
u.s. helicopters destroyed three iranian gunboats after an
  american helicopter came under fire earlier this month and u.s.
  forces attacked, seized, and sank an iranian ship they said had
  been caught laying mines.
but iran was not deterred, according to u.s. defense
  officials, who said iranian forces used chinese-made silkworm
  missiles to hit a u.s.-owned liberian-flagged ship on thursday
  and the sea isle city on friday.
both ships were hit in the territorial waters of kuwait, a
  key backer of iraq in its war with iran.
henry schuler, a former u.s. diplomat in the middle east
  now with csis said washington had agreed to escort kuwaiti
  tankers in order to deter iranian attacks on shipping.
but he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level
  of violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result
  of u.s. intervention and iran's response.
the attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a
  u.s. "tit-for-tat" policy that gave iran the initiative, said
  harlan ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with csis.
he said with this appraoch america would suffer "the death
  of one thousand cuts."
but for the united states to grab the initiative
  militarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining iran's
  harbors or blockading the mouth of the gulf through which its
  shipping must pass, schuler said.
he was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing
  iran to the neogtiating table.
if vital supplies were cut off,
  tehran could not continue the war with iraq.
ullman said washington should join moscow in a diplomatic
  initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an
  arms embargo against tehran if it refused to negotiate.
he said the united states should also threaten to mine and
  blockade iran if it continued fighting and must press iraq to
  acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a
  settlement.
iranian and western diplomats say iraq started the war by
  invading iran's territory in 1980.
iraq blames iran for the
  outbreak of hostilities, which have entailed world war i-style
  infantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties.
each side has attacked the others' shipping.

diplomats call u.s.
attack on oil rig restrained
  a u.s. attack on an iranian oil platform
  in the gulf on monday appeared to be a tit-for-tat raid
  carefully orchestrated not to be too provocative or upset arab
  allies, western diplomats in the region said.
u.s. defence secretary caspar weinberger said monday that
  u.s.
warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern gulf
  in response to a missile strike on the american-registered
  kuwaiti tanker sea isle city in kuwaiti waters on friday.
"we consider the matter closed," he said, a signal the u.s.
  administration did not want the gulf crisis to escalate.
iran had warned the united states earlier in the day
  against exacerbating the gulf crisis, saying military action
  would endanger american interests.
following the raid, a okesman for tehran's war
  information headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a
  "crushing blow."
"the united states has entered a swamp from which it can in
  no way get out safely," tehran radio quoted him as saying.
diplomats noted, however, iran was also seeking to avoid
  ostracism by arab states due to meet at a summit in amman on
  november 8 and discuss the iran-iraq war.
iranian prime minister mir-hossein mousavi is currently in
  damascus, and diplomats said he would seek syrian help in
  preventing a total arab breach with tehran.
further escalation of the war threatening the gulf arab
  states could work against tehran at the amman gathering, they
  said.
"the ball is in iran's court now.
it's up to tehran to
  respond one way or the other," a diplomat said.
president ronald reagan warned iran of stronger american
  countermeasures if the military escalation continued.
western diplomats and military sources in the area said
  shelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative act
  the united states could have taken once it had decided to
  retaliate for the tanker attack, blamed by both the americans
  and kuwaitis on iran.
"it's interesting that they chose something in international
  waters because it doesn't implicate any other nation," one
  diplomat said.
"this was better for u.s. relations with the gulf
  arab states, particularly kuwait."
commented another diplomat: "kuwait must be happy that the
  u.s. has done something, but relieved that faw was not attacked
  on its doorstep."
one source said of the attack on the oil platform: "they
  managed to warn off the crew and hit something that was the
  least nuisance to everybody."
a diplomat commented: "they were very clever in the place
  they chose.
it gets attention, but it hasn't devastated
  anything because it wasn't working in the first place."
a senior arab banker in the area said after the news broke:
  "this was a good, measured response without risking a flare-up
  ...
it is a face-saving response (for the americans)."

latest attack seen pointing up dilemmas for us
  military experts say the united states
  faces a dilemma in the gulf following u.s. destruction of an
  iranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on a
  u.s.-flagged tanker.
the experts told reuters tehran holds the initiative and is
  likely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict as
  long as america simply reacts to iranian attacks by launching
  limited retaliatory strikes.
but if washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps
  -- such as mining iran's harbors, blockading its shipping, or
  destroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war.
"iran is in the driver's seat in an absolute sense as the
  cycle of attack and retaliation continues," said fred axelgard,
  a gulf war expert with the private center for strategic and
  international studies (csis).
"it's like a greek tragedy," said retired adm. eugene carroll
  of washington's private center for defense information (cdi)
  think tank.
some middle east experts say the only way out is for
  washington to join forces with moscow in pressing for an end to
  the war between iran and iraq.
they say it is not feasible for america to withdraw its
  30-ship force from the gulf area, where the navy began
  escorting u.s.-flagged kuwaiti tankers in july.
withdrawal 
  would give the appearance of being chased away by iran, which
  president reagan could never accept.
u.s. defense secretary caspar weinberger told a pentagon
  news conference the destroyers kidd, young, leftwich and hoel
  fired about 1,000 rounds of five-inch shells at iran's rostam
  oil rig 120 miles east of bahrain beginning at about 1400 gulf
  time (0700 edt) on monday.
weinberger said the platform had been used as a military
  base by iran and that the attack responded to an iranian
  silkworm missile strike on the u.s.-flagged kuwaiti tanker sea
  isle city on friday.
iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and
  allowed to escape.
"we do not seek further confrontation with iran, but we will
  be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by iran
  with stronger countermeasures," weinberger said.
"we consider this matter closed," he said.
analysts ranging from the liberal cdi to conservatives
  agreed the u.s. reaction was measured, reasonable and did not
  escalate the conflict unduly.
but they said the question was
  whether iran would consider the matter closed.
it had not taken
  this view after earlier clashes.

  sharholders.
under the plan, the board declared a dividend of one share

  record as of november two, the company said.
initially, the rights are not exerciseable, rights
  certificates are not distributed, and the rights automatically
  trade with northeast's shares, the company said.
however, 20 days following the acquisition of 20 pct or
  more of northeast's common shares shares or 20 days following
  the commencement of a tender offer for 30 pct or more of

u.s.
drafts sanctions in argentina soy case
  the u.s. is drafting options including
  possible trade retaliation against argentina in a dispute over
  the differential between soybean and product  taxes which
  buenos aires levies on exports.
the drafting of retaliation options follows the failure
  of high-level talks earlier this month to resolve a case filed
  by the u.s. national soybean processors association, u.s.
  officials said.
the nspa charged that argentina's differential
  export taxes implicitly subsidize soyproduct exports in
  competition with the u.s.
      "our only option is some sort of retaliation to restrict
  (argentine) access to our market," said one u.s. source.
the u.s. shelved the nspa case earlier this year after
  trade representative clayton yeutter said argentina agreed to
  end the differential.
but when argentina announced export taxes for the 1987/88
  year in july, the differential was narrowed only one pct.
deputy trade representative michael smith met agriculture
  minister ernesto figuerras and economy minister juan sourroille
  on september 29 and the argentine officials said they could not
  narrow the differential further for 1987/88.
as a result of the impasse, the u.s. is considering
  restrictions on imports of items such as argentine corned beef
  and finished leather, the u.s. sources said.
a decision on reprisals is likely to be made by the reagan
  administration soon, they said.

balladur urges g-7 to respect louvre accord
  french finance minister edouard balladur
  said the group of seven (g-7) industrial countries should
  respect pledges on monetary policy made in the february louvre
  accord on currency stability.
"we have to strengthen the cooperation between the seven
  major industrial countries and remind ourselves of the pledges
  we made at the louvre," he told journalists.
"they were not simply pledges to maintain currency
  stability, but also to conduct a certain type of economic and
  monetary policy," he added.
soviet 1988 grain target indicates 1987 output
  recent announcements from moscow of
  next year's grain production targets indicate that the soviets
  are estimating this year's grain crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes,
  agriculture department analysts said.
usda is projecting the soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes, but
  some earlier estimates from soviet officials were that the 1987
  grain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes.
moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on monday,
  putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes.
an analyst of
  soviet agriculture at usda noted that a recent article in
  izvestia said soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be
  "25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year."
"this indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213
  mln tonne (grain) crop," the analyst said.
in calculating moscow's crop estimate, usda used the 235
  mln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figure
  published in a soviet economic journal this month.
usda's production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects a
  range of 207 to 212 mln tonnes, a usda source said.
late season rains damaged soviet crops, slowed harvest
  progress and lowered soviet production, analysts said.
while in the u.s. earlier this month, soviet agriculture
  official viktor nikonov predicted that the grain crop would be
  as good or better than last year's 210 mln tonne harvest.
a member of nikonov's party commented that although 230 mln
  tonnes of grain were in the fields, harvest problems would
  bring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes.

fed's johnson says louvre accord still vital
  federal reserve board vice chairman
  manuel johnson said the louvre accord is still healthy, but
  said the united states and west germany must work out
  differences over their respective roles in fulfilling the
  accord.
"the louvre accord has worked very well in terms of
  stabilizing exchange rates," he said in response to a question
  during an american stock exchange conference here.
he said exchange rates have been stable so far in 1987 as a
  result of the accord.

hanna co &lt;hnm> to acqure &lt;pms consolidated>
  m.a.
hanna co said it has reached 
  definitive agreement to purchase pms consolidated, a privately
  owned manufacturer of colorants for the plastics industry.
m.a.
hanna said the purchase, which is subject to certain
  conditions, is scheduled to close around the end of october.
hanna announced last august that it was in negotiaitons to
  purchase the company.
headquartered in somerset, n.j., pms reported over 70 mln
  dlrs in revenues in its last fiscal year, which ended may 1987.
fed's johnson sees easing of inflationary fears
  federal reserve board vice-chairman
  manuel johnson said the inflationary expectations in the
  financial markets have eased since the fed's last half-point
  increase in its discount rate to 6.0 pct.
"we have seen the kind of expectational forces develop i
  think that we've been satisfied with since our last discount
  rate move," johnson said.
fed chairman alan greenspan has said the most recent
  discount rate increase on september 4 was largely aimed at
  quelling inflationary fears in financial markets which he said
  were largely unfounded.
ample supplies limit u.s. strike's oil price impact
  ample supplies of opec crude weighing on
  world markets helped limit and then reverse oil price gains
  that followed the u.s. strike on an iranian oil platform in the
  gulf earlier on monday, analysts said.
december loading rose to 19.65 dlrs, up 45 cents before
  falling to around 19.05/15 later, unchanged from last friday.
"fundamentals are awful," said philip lambert, analyst with
  stockbrokers kleinwort grieveson, adding that total opec
  production in the first week of october could be above 18.5 mln
  bpd, little changed from september levels.
peter nicol, analyst at chase manhattan bank, said opec
  production could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in october.
reuter and
  international energy agency (iea) estimates put opec september
  production at 18.5 mln bpd.
the u.s.
attack was in retaliation of last friday's hit of
  a kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the u.s.
flag, the sea
  isle city.
it was struck by a missile, believed to be iranian,
  in kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a u.s.
flag
  commercial vessel in the seven year iran/iraq war.
the u.s.
owned liberian flag tanker sungari was hit in the
  area on thursday, also believed struck by an iranian missile.
refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on
  monday as a result increased gulf tension following the u.s.
attack, analysts said.
they said a closure of the strait of hormuz, through which
  around eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not in
  the interests of the u.s. or iran, they said.
any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in
  the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of gulf
  hostilities, analysts said.
but they saw the u.s. strike as a limited reply to iranian
  missile attacks, with some describing it as responsible.
geoffrey pyne, analyst at stockbrokers phillips and drew,
  said he was impressed by the sensible u.s.
response.
"the u.s. has thought carefully about what would correspond
  to iranian agression.
they have proved to the iranians that any
  further action will be met with a like-for-like response.
today's action by the u.s. was not escalatory," pyne said.
kleinwort grieveson's lambert said the u.s. strike was "a
  responsible retaliation," with the u.s.
apparently indicating to
  iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf iran
  chose to raise the level of conflict.
chase manhattan's nicol took a different view, however.
he said he was unable to see what the u.s. had achieved as
  arab states such as kuwait and saudi arabia, whose interests
  the u.s. is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a
  result of the u.s.
attack and fear some sort of iranian
  retaliation.
the initial upward market move this morning reflected a
  strong speculative reaction to rumours of a u.s.
attack which
  was thought at one stage to have been against iranian missile
  launchers on the faw peninsula, close to kuwait, analysts said.
the later downtrend followed confirmation of a u.s. navy
  attack on an iranian oil platform by the u.s. defence secretary
  caspar weinburger.
market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the
  gulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it less
  serious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower,
  analysts and traders said.

iran vows reprisal for u.s.
attack on oil rig
  iran said several people were injured in
  monday's u.s.
attack on an iranian offshore oil site and vowed
  retaliation, tehran radio reported.
it quoted president ali khamenei as saying, "we will
  definitely retaliate and will not leave this american move
  unanswered."
a broadcast monitored in nicosia said several civilian
  personnel on the rashadat oil platforms in the gulf east of
  qatar were injured when u.s.
warships bombarded them this
  afternoon.
it described damage as "severe."
washington said four american frigates shelled and
  destroyed two iranian platforms at the rashadat (formerly
  rostam) field at 1100 gmt on monday in response to friday's
  missile attack on a u.s.-flag ship in kuwaiti waters.
the u.s. said iranians used the platforms for military
  pruposes and had fired on an american helicopter from the rigs
  earlier this month.
khamenei denied that the platforms had military gear or
  personnel and said the u.s.
attack lacked miltary value.

fed's johnson warns against lower dollar
  federal reserve board vice-chairman
  manuel johnson cautioned against seeking "quick-fix solutions" to
  persistent u.s. trade and federal budget deficits.
in particular, he told an american stock exchange
  conference, a decline in the dollar below current levels would
  exacerbate financial market conditions.
"trying to artificially depress the dollar severely below
  current levels ... would exacerbate financial market conditions
  and lead to further potential for financial problems."
nowhere, johnson said, are fed officials hearing that u.s.
  businesses cannot compete at current exchange rates.
he acknowledged the u.s. trade deficit was persisting
  despite a decline in the dollar's value of 40 to 50 pct in the
  past two years.
but the deficit is improving in volume terms and will soon
  begin showing improvement.
"the stage i think is being set for a healthy, constructive
  expansion without inflationary instability," he said.

security council calls talks after gulf attack
  the u.n. security council was
  called to a private meeting on monday for consultations 
  following the united states attack on an iranian oil platform.
meanwhile, a u.n. spokesman said that as far as he knew a
  report to the council and secretary general javier perez de
  cuellar on the action had not been received from the americans.
in washington, president reagan said the united nations was
  being informed of the attack under the provision of the u.n.
  charter regarding notification of actions taken under the right
  of self-defense.
the u.n. spokesman, francois giuliani, said perez de
  cuellar had no comment on the attack, taken in response to
  iranian action against an american-owned tanker last week, but
  was trying to find out "what actually happened."
calls to iran's u.n. commission elicited no response.

baring unit sets up fund for management buy-outs
  baring capital investors ltd (bci), a unit
  of the u.k.
merchant bank &lt;baring brothers and co ltd>, said it
  has raised 61 mln european currency units (ecus) which will be
  invested in management buy-outs and development capital
  opportunities in the u.k. and continental europe.
the funds were raised through bci's first such fund - the
  baring euaring european capital trust - from investors in nine
  european countries.
it expects to raise another 40 mln ecus
  soon through a french fund and a fund for u.s. investors.
bci was set up last year by baring brothers to advise
  buy-out and development capital investors.
bci said the new fund is structured as a guernsey-based
  unit trust, which will be listed on the luxembourg stock
  exchange.
it will be advised by bci and managed by a company
  owned jointly by barings and the management of bci.
individual investments are expected to range between one
  and 10 mln ecus and are likely to be concentrated in the u.k.,
  germany and france.
bci said its aims are to invest in established companies,
  principally family companies with succession-issues and
  corporate spin-offs.
g-7 seen fighting to keep currency pact
  international monetary officials will 
  rush to paper over the deep cracks that have appeared in the
  louvre accord on currency stability to prevent a dollar
  free-fall and to calm turmoil in world capital markets,
  economists and currency traders said.
"i don't think the louvre is dead because if it breaks up
  in an acrimonious way, the potential outcome is a rout of the
  dollar, higher interest rates and collapsing stock markets.
it's in the group of seven's interest to calm things down,"
  said douglas madison, corporate trader at bankamerica corp.
in a weekend television interview, u.s. treasury secretary
  james baker sharply criticised a recent rise in west german
  money market rates and said the eight month-old louvre pact to
  foster exchange rate stability needs to be reviewed.
his comments rocked the currency markets and helped send
  the already-fragile u.s. and overseas stock markets into a
  tailspin.
the dollar lost more than two pfennigs in the u.s. to about
  1.7740/50 marks and about one yen to 141.25/35 yen.
the dow
  jones industrial average slumped more than 200 points at one
  stage and u.s. treasury bonds dropped about 1-3/4 points.

  crazy eddie inc said its board will

      crazy eddie said its board is not endorsing, but will
  simply refrain from opposing, the emi-palmieri nominees.
the board also said it will ask representatives of the
  committee to restore shareholder value to begin acquainting
  themselves with the business and affairs of the company as
  promptly as possible.
to that end, the committee's representatives will be
  invited in advance of the annual meeting to examine the
  company's financial records, to monitor its operations and to
  join company officers in meetings with the company's suppliers,
  bankers and key personnel, crazy eddie said.
the board said that to continue to oppose the emi-palmieri
  group would only increase the expenses of the company, create
  further uncertainty among its suppliers, customers and
  employees, and result in deterioration of moral among company
  personnel.
a further release from the company will follow, it said.

iran says us attack involves it in full-scale war
  a top iranian military official said
  america's attack on an iranian oil platform on monday had
  involved the united states in full-scale war and iran would
  avenge it with a "crushing blow."
"the united states has entered a swamp from which it can in
  no way get out safely," the iranian news agency irna quoted the
  head of iran's war information headquarters as saying.
the official, kamal kharrazi, said washington had now
  become involved in what he called a full-fledged war with iran.
it was the first official iranian reaction to the attack by
  four u.s. navy destroyers on the reshadat oil platform.

senate panel studies loan rate, set aside plans
  the senate agriculture committee was
  expected to consider proposals that would limit adjustments in
  county loan rate differentials which trigger larger corn and
  wheat acreage reduction requirements, senate staff said.
a budget-saving proposal drafted by chairman patrick leahy
  (d-vt) would limit adjustments in county loan rate
  differentials to no more than one pct per year from the
  national average loan rate, starting with 1988 crops.
the plan also would allow the agriculture secretary to
  increase the unpaid acreage reduction requirement for corn by
  "an appropriate amount to generate savings" if projected corn
  stocks exceeded 6.0 billion bushels.
leahy's proposal would also allow a larger 1988 wheat set
  aside if projected stocks surpassed 1.9 billion bushels.

transatlantic row imperils louvre accord-dealers
  the louvre accord on currency stability,
  which has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets since
  last february, appeared in serious danger today as a
  transatlantic dispute over west german interest rates came to
  the boil, foreign exchange dealers said.
but as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and
  bond markets plunged, officials in the major industrial
  countries played down the dispute as a bilateral problem
  between the united states and west germany and insisted that
  the currency pact was still alive.
u.s. treasury secretary james baker sparked the market
  fears when he attacked the rise in west german short-term
  interest rates.
"that's not in keeping with the spirit of what
  we agreed to as recently as earlier this month in washington,"
  baker said in a u.s. television interview on sunday.
he was
  referring to the meetings of finance ministers from the group
  of seven (g7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the
  pact.
under the louvre accord west germany and japan, who both
  have large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economic
  growth to take in more exports from the u.s., while the u.s.
agreed to stop talking the dollar down.
however, baker said on saturday that while the louvre
  agreement was still operative, the west german interest rate
  move would force the u.s. to re-examine the accord.
"the foreign exchange market has been told by baker that
  he's going to hammer germany ...
he has just declared all bets
  are off in terms of currency cooperation," chris johns, currency
  analyst at ubs-phillips and drew in london said.
but a bank of japan official took a much more sanguine
  view, telling reuters that "the exchange market is apparently
  reacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the baker
  comment will regret it later on."
french finance minister edouard balladur, who hosted the
  louvre meeting, was the only one of the g7 finance ministers to
  respond directly to baker's remarks.
he called for "a faithful
  and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the
  louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit."
neither the west german finance ministry nor the british
  treasury commented on the row.
but a japanese finance ministry official said that despite
  u.s.
frustration over higher interest rates abroad, "this does
  not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the
  louvre accord."
in frankfurt f. wilhelm christians, joint chief executive
  of west germany's largest bank, deutsche bank, said that
  following recent meetings with baker, he believed that the u.s.
  was still committed to the accord.
in a move which the market interpreted as a possible
  gesture of reconciliation, the bundesbank added short-term
  liquidity to the west german money market at 3.80 pct on
  monday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injected
  medium-term liquidity last week.
the bank of france also
  stepped into the french money market to hold down rates,
  injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates rose
  close to eight pct.
northview &lt;novc.o> plans to sell company
  northview corp said it reached

  offer for all of its outstanding stock at a price of 22 dlrs
  per share in cash.
calmark, headquartered in los angeles, develops, manages
  and syndicates real estate, northview also said.

sweden's boliden to open saudi arabian gold mine
  mining group boliden ab said it had
  agreed with saudi state agency general petroleum and mineral
  organisation (petromin) to open a gold mine in saudi arabia to
  exploit one of the world's richest deposits of the metal.
boliden spokesman goran paulson told reuters the swedish
  group would  be responsible for the technical side of the
  operation and would have no control over the product itself.
he said one option under discussion for refining the gold
  ore would be to ship it to boliden's ronnskar copper smelter in
  northern sweden.
paulson declined to give a figure for the deal but said it
  was strategically important since it increased boliden's
  presence in saudi arabia.
"representatives from petromin have visited ronnskar
  already...we see saudi arabia as the expansion area of the
  future," he said.
the new mine, which is being developed at mahd adh dhahab
  in the west of the country and should open in the first half of
  1988, would have an annual output of about 3,000 kilos of gold
  smelted from around 120,000 tons of ore, he said.
boliden already owns 50 pct of a gold ore deposit in saudi
  arabia, but the new venture will be the first saudi mine to
  open in modern times.
"this is a breakthrough for boliden's sales of mining
  technology and knowhow," said the group's chief executive, kjell
  nilsson.

uk sugar factory closes due to shortage of beet
  british sugar plc was forced to shut its
  ipswich sugar factory on sunday afternoon due to an acute
  shortage of beet supplies, a spokesman said, responding to a
  reuter inquiry
      beet supplies have dried up at ipswich due to a combination
  of very wet weather, which has prevented most farmers in the
  factory's catchment area from harvesting, and last week's
  hurricane which blocked roads.
the ipswich factory will remain closed until roads are
  cleared and supplies of beet build up again.
this is the first time in many years that a factory has
  been closed in mid-campaign, the spokesman added.
other factories are continuing to process beet normally,
  but harvesting remains very difficult in most areas.
ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by british
  sugar.
it processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a year
  out of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes.
despite the closure of ipswich and the severe harvesting
  problems in other factory areas, british sugar is maintaining
  its estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2
  mln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, the
  spokesman said.
british sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the u.k.
the sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month,
  is expected to run until the end of january.
sugar factories
  normally work 24 hours a day, seven days a week during the
  campaign.
as of october 11, 12 pct of the u.k. sugar crop had been
  harvested, little different to the same stage last year when 13
  pct had been lifted.
since then, however, very wet weather has
  severely restricted beet lifting.
harvesting figures for the week to october 18 are not yet
  available.

multifoods &lt;imc> files suit against bregman
  international multifoods corp
  said it filed a suit charging bregman partners and its
  affiliates unlawfully planned to acquire control of the
  company.
in a suit filed in u.s. district court, international
  multifoods said bregman partners and its affiliates, who
  reportedly hold 7.4 pct of the company's shares, tried to
  induce multifood's management to join them in an effort to take
  the company private and give controlling interest to bregman
  partners.
bregman partners include the interests of the
  belzberg families of canada.
the complaint also discloses that on each occasion,
  multifoods management rejected the group's overtures.
multifoods is asking bregman's group to divest its shares
  in open market sales in a manner not to further disrupt the
  market place, according to the suit.
the suit seeks
  compensatory and punitive damages in an amount to be
  determined.
in addition, multifoods is seeking to stop bregman partners
  from acquiring any more stock, or voting the shares it
  reportedly owns, the suit said.
according to multifoods, the actions proposed by bregman
  partners would prevent shareholders from realizing the full
  benefits of the company's restructuring.
in the past three years, multifoods has substantially
  altered its domestic business mix by divesting its u.s.
  consumere foods operations and emphasizing growth in selected
  segments of the u.s. foodservice industry.

west germany still committed to louvre accord

over the weekend, u.s. treasury secretary james baker
  criticised recent rises in west german short-term interest

he said the agreement may have to be re-examined.
the sources said the west german interest rate rises had to

  banking was sound.
"the potential for greater interest rate rises gives us
  concern.
we see nothing right now in the outlook that causes us
  to believe rates are going much higher or that the economy is
  not sound," seidman told a news conference.

study says pork leaner than usda figures show
  an iowa state university study showed
  pork contains considerably less fat than indicated by
  long-established u.s. department of agriculture statistics, the
  national pork producers council (nppc) said.
six of the seven muscle cuts evaluated in the study
  averaged 4.3 pct fat or less, well below american heart
  association guidelines for recommended foods.
eighty pct of all
  the raw boneless rib chops evaluated in the study contained
  less than six pct fat, the nppc said.
meanwhile, usda handbook 8-10 - long used as the
  established authority on nutrient composition, indicates a fat
  content for center loin pork of 7.3 pct, the nppc said.
robin kline, a dietitian and director of consumer affairs
  for the nppc said he was not surprised at the wide discrepancy
  between the study and the usda handbook.
"handbook 8-10 is based to a certain extent on information
  that has been accumulated over the past 30 years.
the
  statistics in it about pork do not reflect the hog of today
  which is about 50 pct leaner than it was 20 or 30 years ago,
  thanks to genetic improvements and better feeding practices,"
  kline said.
the study, funded by nppc with producer checkoff money,
  evaluated pork carcasses from 47 iowa producers in categories
  from 0.7 to 1.3 inches of backfat.
researchers measured the fat
  content of the seven muscles before cooking, and the fat,
  moisture and tenderness of cooked boneless rib chops.
soviets outline 1988 economic targets
  the soviet union outlined its economic
  targets for 1988 on monday, stressing the need to improve
  standards in the country's sluggish engineering industry.
planning chief nikolai talyzin told the supreme soviet
  industrial output should rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a
  planned 4.4 pct in 1987.
it rose 3.6 pct in jan-sept 1987.
talyzin said national income, the nearest soviet equivalent
  to gross national product, should rise by 4.3 pct against a
  planned 4.1 pct this year.
gross national product measures the
  output of a country's goods and services.
he said the kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes of
  grain in 1988 versus a planned 232 mln this year.
moscow
  produced 210 mln tonnes in 1986.
kremlin leader mikhail gorbachev has described
  machine-builing as a sector whose rapid modernization is
  essential if the soviet union is to compete effectively on
  world markets.
"certain difficulties have arisen this year in the
  machine-building industry.
the economy is not receiving a
  considerable amount of the equipment that it requires," said
  talyzin, who heads the state planning committee gosplan.
soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes
  machine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,
  increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of 1987
  compared with the same period last year.
however, this was far below the 7.3 pct increase planned
  for the industry for the whole of 1988.
talyzin said the ruling politburo had concluded at a recent
  meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to
  a large extent on conserving resources better.
"large-scale
  measures are planned to save resources," he said.
finance minister boris gostev told the supreme soviet that
  defense spending in 1988 would total 32 billion dlrs, the same
  figure as was announced last year.
western governments view official soviet estimates for
  defense spending as highly understated, but say the real figure
  is hard to calculate because soviet military industries are
  intertwined with the civilian economy.
talyzin said the kremlin also decided to increase spending
  next year on medical services, education, pensions and social
  insurance schemes.
tass denounces u.s.
attack on iran as adventurism
  the official soviet news agency tass
  denounced a u.s.
attack on an iranian oil-drilling platform in
  the gulf on monday as military adventurism and said it would
  bring no dividends to the reagan administration.
tass commentator mikhail krutikhin said the administration
  had embarked on an adventurist path in order to deflect
  attention from the scandal in which the united states sold arms
  to iran and the profits were diverted to nicaraguan rebels.
"the confrontation is a fact now.
what is obvious is that
  the latest military adventure will not bring political
  dividends to the american administration," krutikhin said.
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and foreign minister eduard
  shevardnadze abruptly left a parliamentary session earlier on
  monday, sparking diplomatic speculation that they were
  concerned with an urgent matter of foreign affairs.
soviet officials have previously criticized the united
  states for sending naval forces into the gulf, saying their
  presence serves to increase tension.
moscow is officially neutral in the war between iran and
  iraq.
it is a major arms supplier to iraq but has also sought
  broader contacts with iran in the last year.
krutikhin said: "the united states has undertaken an act of
  armed aggression against iran, the probability of which has
  long been spoken of by washington officials."
world telecoms watchdog relaxes car phone rules
  the international telecommunications
  union, which regulates communications worldwide, decided at the
  end of a five-week conference to allow mobile phone systems to
  be linked with satellites, telecommunications officials said.
until now, car phones have been linked with land stations
  and have been limited mainly to urban areas.
the new ruling
  will make it easier for calls to be made from remote regions.
the meeting, which finished over the weekend, also decided
  to allow a "radio determination satellite system," which would
  enable fleet owners to trace to within about 15 metres the
  movements of their lorries or cars or ships around the world.

ic industries &lt;icx> may sell aerospace unit
  ic industries inc said its board approved
  a second major step in the reorganization and restructuring of
  the company.
to implement the plan of sharpening its strategic focus on
  consumer goods and services, the company will give serious
  consideration to the sale of its pneumo abex, its aerospace and
  defense company, if it can realize a price which will return
  maximum value to shareholders.
in 1986, pneumo abex had operating income of 118.1 mln dlrs
  on sales of 900.5 mln dlrs.
ic said it will use the proceeds of any asset sale to
  invest in new high-return businesses in the consumer goods and
  services field.
the company said it authorized a program to repurchase
  between 500 mln dlrs and 1.0 billion dlrs of ic's common stock
  from time to time when conditions warrant.
it also said it will begin an immediate cost-reduction
  program to cust annual operating expenses by 50 mln dlrs.
an ic spokesman said the cost-reduction program involved
  "across-the-board" cuts rather than specific about targeted
  areas.
ic's board earlier approved a plan to spin off the
  company's illinois central gulf railroad to shareholders.
the
  company's other major subsidiaries are pet inc, pepsi-cola
  general bottlers, midas international corp and hussmann corp.

cairns group said influential in trade talks
  australian minister for trade
  negotiations michael duffy said his country and third world
  commodity producers have formed an effective lobby group
  against farm export subsidies and market access restrictions.
duffy told a press conference the cairns group of 14 major
  agricultural producers, to which australia and thailand belong,
  has emerged as an important third force in any multilateral
  trade talks.
"there's no doubt that the cairns group is being
  seen as a third force to be reckoned with both inside the
  general agreement on tariffs and trade and in other
  international trade negotiations," he said.
duffy, here on a three-day visit after talks in the united
  states, the european community (ec) and latin america, said
  considerable progress has been made by the group towards
  fighting costly protectionist policies pursued by developed
  countries.
the minister said the ec commission's new farm trade paper
  will recognise the heavy financial burdens imposed by its
  common agricultural policy and its future expansion.
he said the reagan administration has also displayed a
  determination to resist the currently strong protectionist
  sentiment in the u.s. congress.
turkey current account deficit widens in july
  turkey's current account deficit widened
  in july to 674 mln dlrs from 454 mln in june but fell from 1.22
  billion in july last year, the state statistics institute said.
the cumulative trade position in july showed a 1.85 billion
  dlr deficit after 1.33 billion in june and 1.89 billion a year
  earlier, with exports at 4.91 billion and imports, both fob, at
  6.76 billion.
the government aims to narrow the current account deficit
  for the whole of 1987 to 975 mln dlrs, compared with 1.52
  billion last year, up from 1.01 billion in 1985.
bankers forecast the 1987 deficit will exceed one billion
  dlrs,  because a spurt in exports is expected to slow
  considerably in the last five months following a massive
  drawdown of inventories.

soviet union sets 4.5 pct industrial output growth
  soviet planning chief nikolai talyzin told
  the supreme soviet (parliament) industrial output is planned to
  rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a planned 4.4 pct in 1987.
in the first nine months of this year, industrial output
  rose by 3.6 pct.
talyzin said national income, the nearest soviet equivalent
  to gross national product, is planned to rise by 4.3 pct
  against a planned 4.1 pct this year.
he said grain production is planned at 235 mln tonnes in
  1988, compared with a planned 232 mln this year.
the soviet union produced 210 mln tonnes of grain in 1986
  and the soviet press has said heavy rain has affected the
  harvest this year.
talyzin said the 1988 soviet plan stressed the engineering
  industry, which kremlin leader mikhail gorbachev has described
  as a sector where rapid modernisation is essential if the
  soviet union is to compete effectively on world markets.
"certain difficulties have arisen this year in the
  machine-building industry.
the economy is not receiving a
  considerable amount of the equipment that it requires," said
  talyzin, who heads the state planning committee gosplan.
soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes
  machine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,
  increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of this
  year against the same period of 1986.
this is well below the
  7.3 pct rise planned for the industry for all of 1988.
talyzin said the ruling politburo concluded at a recent
  meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to
  a large extent on conserving resources better.
"large-scale
  measures are planned to save resources," he said.
finance minister boris gustev told the supreme soviet
  defence spending in 1988 would total 20.2 billion roubles, the
  same as announced last year.
talyzin said the kremlin also had decided to increase
  spending next year on medical services, education, pensions and
  social insurance schemes
      he said state expenditures in these fields would reach 171
  billion roubles in 1988, or 3.5 billion roubles more than had
  originally been envisaged in the 1986-1990 five-year plan.

u.s.
naval forces attack iranian oil platform
  u.s. warships attacked and destroyed
  an iranian oil platform on monday in retaliation for friday's
  iranian attack damaging a u.s.-flagged ship, u.s. defense
  secretary caspar weinberger said.
when asked how much was left of the oil platform,
  weinberger said, "nothing."
"there was no iranian reaction," he said.
"... we consider
  this matter is now closed."
weinberger said four u.s. destroyers attacked the platform
  about 120 miles east of bahrain in the central gulf with fire
  at 0700 edt, weinberger said.
"we chose a platform used by the iranians to interfere with
  and be a source of potential attack on convoys...," weinberger
  said at a pentagon briefing.
"we know it has been used indeed, to not only launch small
  boat attacks on shipping but to fire on u.s. helicopters...
      "it's removal will contribute significantly to the safety of
  u.s. forces in the future," weinberger said of the u.s. navy's
  operation to escort oil tankers through the gulf.
"we do not seek further confrontation with iran but we will
  be prepared to meet any escalation of military actions by iran
  with stronger countermeasures," weinberger said.
he said the 20 to 30 iranian personnel on the oil platform
  were given a 20-minute warning to abandon the platform.
"as far as we know they did abandon the site," he said.
weinberger was asked why the united states had chosen to
  attack an oil platform rather than iranian silkworm missile
  platforms blamed by washington for friday's attack.

earlier today the company announced that hong kong
  telephone and cable and wireless hong kong, in which the

  subsidiaries of a newly formed holding company, hong kong
  telecommunications.
in exchange for the cable and wireless hong kong capital,

      that subsidiary now holds the group's 80 pct stake in cable

it will issue an additional 1.05 billion shares to the
  goverment.
that will leave the cable and wireless group with an 80 pct

  and nine pct in public hands.
but that will be reduced early next year after a placement

gaf &lt;gaf> group reconsiders buyout bid
  gaf corp said the management group
  led by chairman samuel j. heyman intends to reconsider its
  proposal to acquire gaf.
on september 8, the group offered 64.00 dlrs in cash and
  2.50 dlrs principal amount of 15 pct junior subordinated
  debentures due 2007 for each gaf share.
heyman owns about
  2,700,000 of gaf's 33.5 mln shares outstanding.
in a letter to the committee of independent directors
  formed to consider the offer, heyman said it will have to
  modify the terms of the offer if it is to continue the bid, due
  to rising interest rates and financial market conditions.
heyman said "in the considerable time that has elapsed
  since our original proposal was submitted, the credit and
  financial markets have experienced extraordinary and almost
  unprecedented deterioration.
as of the present time, the
  average interest rate on the financing which we proposed to
  raise in connection with the acquisition has increased, since
  the original proposal, by approximately 150 basis points."
he said the group intends to promptly review all available
  options, including the revision of its offer to reflect current
  market conditions.
s.korea current a/c surplus seen near 10 bln dlrs
  south korea's national news agency, yonhap,
  said this year's current account surplus will near 10 billion
  dlrs amid signs of continuing high world demand for the
  country's cheap cars and electronic goods.
bank of korea officials would neither confirm nor deny the
  yonhap forecast, saying only that the bank would issue its own
  figures later in the week.
yonhap said the january-september surplus in the current
  account, which covers trade in goods and services, totalled
  7.03 billion dlrs.
this already exceeds the seven billion dlr ceiling for the
  whole of 1987 that the government set in june during talks with
  the international monetary fund aimed at averting a too rapid
  revaluation of the won against the dollar.
the agency said the september surplus was 1.4 billion dlrs,
  up from 468.1 mln in august and 899 mln a year earlier.
"exports in october could be relatively modest due to many
  public holidays, but by the end of this year the surplus will
  be well over nine billion dollars, close to ten," yonhap said.
the sharp rise in the september surplus came from a
  resumption of export deliveries delayed by strikes the previous
  month.
more than 3,300 companies, including car manufacturers,
  electronic and electric firms, were hit by labour unrest
  between july and september.
the south korean government originally targeted a five
  billion dlr current account surplus this year, but had to raise
  this to seven billion to reflect a startling first-half export
  boom.
if confirmed, the soaring 1987 current account surplus
  seemed certain to trigger tougher pressure from the united
  states which recorded a 7.4 billion dlr trade deficit with
  seoul last year, government economists said.
the u.s. government, trying to stem protectionist pressure
  at home, has called on south korea to open more markets to
  american goods and revalue the won faster.
the won was fixed at 804.90 against the dollar on monday,
  representing a 7.01 pct gain so far this year.

aircraft attack iranian oil rigs in southern gulf
  unidentified jets attacked three iranian
  oil rigs in the southern gulf early on monday, setting at least
  one of them ablaze, regional shipping sources said.
earlier today in washington, u.s. television networks had
  reported that american forces launched a retaliatory strike
  against iran late sunday, attacking two iranian offshore oil
  drilling platforms and setting them ablaze.
the shipping sources said iran's sassan, rostam and rakhsh
  offshore oilfields were attacked at 0700 local (0300 gmt) by a
  wave of jet fighter bombers.
smoke was seen spiralling up from
  the rostam field soon after.
at least one of the other two targets was also believed to
  be ablaze, the sources said.
the sassan and rostam fields have been targets for iraqi
  air strikes in the past, but baghdad had not reported any
  southern gulf missions prior to news of the latest attack.
shipping and military sources in the region have said iran
  used its southern gulf rigs as bases to launch helicopter and
  later speedboat attacks on neutral ships in the waterway.
u.s. officials had been meeting on a response since friday
  when an attack on a kuwaiti port severely damaged a
  u.s.-flagged ship.
president reagan said on sunday he had
  already made a decision on the u.s.
response to friday's iran
  attack but would not say what the decision was.

saudi to remain as key lpg supplier to japan
  saudi arabia is likely to remain the key
  supplier of liquefied petroleum gas (lpg) to japan for at least
  the next five years, oil industry sources said.
japan, while diversifying its supply sources of propane and
  butane for stable supplies, will continue to bank on saudi
  arabian lpg, the sources said.
they said saudi's supply capabilities of lpg, an associate
  of crude oil, is guaranteed by its crude output capacity.
"saudi
  is a reliable supplier in that sense," said one trader.
japan imports about 50 pct of its lpg from saudi arabia.
no single nation could substitute for saudi arabia as an
  lpg supply source to japan, the sources said.
"saudi arabia has committed itself to japanese lpg buyers,
  which has quelled fears that lpg supplies from the mideast gulf
  could easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilities
  in that area," said another trader.
saudi arabia cut lpg shipments to japan and elsewhere by 20
  pct in september after a fire put a major gas plant at
  al-juaimah out of operation.
october shipments were back to
  contractual volumes as saudi was able to boost exports from
  other ports.
attacks on gulf shipping by iran and iraq centered on crude
  rather than products carriers, which has lulled fears of lpg
  supply disruptions, traders said.
they said an iranian blockade of the strait of hormuz was
  unlikely because it would block iran's oil shipments.
industry sources said japan's lpg imports will not greatly
  rise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at a
  moderate 2.1 pct a year from 1986 through 1991.
japanese term buyers of saudi lpg are expected to lift
  slightly lower volumes from january 1987, when imports from
  indonesia are slated to increase, the sources said.
the customers are unlikely to slash saudi term purchases in
  large scale when japan increases annual imports of indonesian
  lpg to 1.95 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319,000 tonnes in the
  year ended march 1987, the sources said.
but when demand is sluggish in summer, they will phase down
  term purchases of saudi lpg and secure lower-priced cargoes on
  the spot market, they said.
japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of lpg a year, of which
  5.3 mln tonnes are supplied by saudi arabia, 3.3 mln under term
  contracts and two mln through spot purchases.
some 80 pct of
  japan's lpg imports are from the middle east.
saudi arabia's state owned oil company petromin has made
  some concessions on term prices to japanese customers in the
  recent round of contract renewal talks, and it is likely the
  japanese will accept the offer, the sources said.
the japanese term customers, however, have so far been
  unsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula to
  replace the existing unilateral monthly price notice.
japanese buyers pay saudi arabia a price notified by
  petromin each month.
most recently the fob price was set at 87
  pct of the 17.52 dlrs per barrel government selling price (gsp)
  of arabian light.
buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftings
  should the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of arabian
  light's gsp.
petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the
  95 pct for contracts with japanese customers from next january,
  the trade sources said.
petromin also suggested that a seller's option of supplying
  up to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject to
  seller-buyer agreement.
under the present contract, petromin can automatically cut
  supplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume.
"if you want to import lpg from saudi arabia on a profitable
  basis, you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct," said
  an official at a major importer.
"freight costs are higher for
  cargoes coming from the gulf than southeast asia due to a
  longer haul and war risk insurance payments."
japanese customers will visit saudi arabia this month to
  finalise their separate contract talks, now focusing on
  contractual period and volume, which could be very similar to
  current levels, the sources said.
"when we talk business, we
  would seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability of
  high dependence on a single supplier," said one.

it said cautiously that u.s. forces attacked late sunday

  as a result, but cbs news and other networks said flatly that
  u.s. forces attacked the iranian oil platforms.

indian reserve bank tightens credit policy
  the reserve bank of india said it was
  tightening its credit policy for commercial banks by raising
  their cash reserve ratio by 0.5 pct to 10 pct, effective from
  october 24.
the move, announced last weekend, is part of the bank's
  policy for the second half of fiscal 1987/88 ending march and
  is aimed at curbing excess bank liquidity.
the central bank also put selective controls on bank
  advances to the oilseeds, vegetable oils and foodgrains trades.
"the policy's main objective is to fully meet the credit
  requirements of agriculture, industry and exports, while
  preventing excessive monetary expansion," bank governor r.n.
malhotra told an earlier meeting of chief executives of banks.
malhotra said the rate of monetary expansion must be kept
  under control in the second half of the current financial year.
bank deposits rose 75.40 billion rupees in the first six
  months of fiscal 1987/88 against 66.92 billion in the same
  period last year, according to the bank.
bankers said the bank's move to raise the cash reserve
  ratio by 0.5 pct will mean impounding about five billion rupees
  from the banking system.
banks' total deposits are estimated at
  around 1,000 billion rupees.
they said banks are under pressure because of low returns
  on commercial lending and investments in government securities.
"already many banks are finding it difficult to maintain
  their statutory liquidity and cash reserve ratios and are
  resorting to heavy inter-bank borrowings," said one banker.

south yemen plans oil export pipeline - mees
  south yemen is planning a major oil
  pipeline system to be completed in 18-months time to start
  exports at a initial rate of 100,000 barrels per day, (bpd) the
  middle east economic survey (mees) said.
mees said government approval for the export pipeline
  followed a visit to aden by a high ranking delegation from the
  soviet union, which will help south yemen construct the line
      the engineering studies for the pipeline are nearly
  finished and construction is expected to start early next year,
  the industry newsletter said.
the pipeline will run about 170-200 kms (105-125 miles)
  from shabwa oilfields to a coastal terminal at bir 'ali on the
  gulf of aden, mees said.
mees said the soviet firm technoexport, which is
  developing oilfileds for south yemen, has substantially
  increased its initial reserve estimates and recommended a
  pipeline with an eventual 500,000 bpd capacity.
the discovery of commercial quaotities of oil was confirmed
  by technoexport earlier this year in three structures in the
  shabwa region in the northwestern part of the country, 200 kms
  east of north yemen's alif oilfield.
trafalgar house buys u.s.
builder for 20 mln dlrs
  trafalgar house plc &lt;traf.l> said it has
  acquired the entire share capital of &lt;capital homes inc> of the
  u.s. for 20 mln dlrs in cash.
capital homes builds single family homes in the washington
  d.c. area and is also active as a land developer both for its
  own use and for sale to other builders.
in the financial year to end february, 1987, capital
  recorded pre-tax profits of 3.7 mln dlrs on a turnover of 58
  mln dlrs from the sale of 421 homes.
capital has a land bank of
  some 2,600 units and in the current year the company expects to
  sell 500 homes, trafalgar house said.
kuwaiti oil exports said not affected by gulf war
  kuwait's oil exports have not been
  affected by the seven-year iran-iraq war, kuwait oil tanker
  company (kotc) chairman and managing director abdul fattah
  al-bader told a kuwaiti newspaper.
"kuwait has exploited all available opportunities to
  continue exporting its oil without any reduction," the al-anbaa
  newspaper quoted him as saying.
he said kotc made profits of more than two mln dinars
  (seven mln dlrs) in the fiscal year ending last june, but
  predicted lower profits this year due to higher costs for
  chartering and operating vessels.
german financial policy makers in rare dissension
  karl otto poehl, head of west germany's
  central bank, and finance minister gerhard stoltenberg are
  normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the
  central bank's independence.
but a rare public row between the ebullient poehl,
  president of the bundesbank, and stoltenberg, over a
  controversial investment tax proposal, has added to the woes of
  the country's already nervous financial markets, bankers said.
poehl told an investment symposium in frankfurt last
  thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and
  interest rates
      stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting poehl's
  criticism, saying west germany would remain an attractive place
  for foreign investors.
"the obvious lack of coordination between the bundesbank and
  finance ministry does not instil confidence in foreign
  investors," said one economist for a london broker, who asked
  not to be identified.
bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial
  policy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship to
  steer the economy through a particularly difficult time.
"there are plenty of objective pressures which will result
  in things getting back to normal again after a period of ill
  feeling," said commerzbank ag chief economist juergen pfister.
news on october 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct
  withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in
  a market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and
  abroad.
bankers said the bundesbank was angered by the way the
  finance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting the
  bundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflicting
  details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market.
both poehl, 57, and stoltenberg, 59, have been under
  extraordinary pressures lately.
poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his
  deputy, helmut schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fight
  inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had
  pursued so far this year to promote currency stability.
in recent statements poehl has sounded more like
  schlesinger.
for years the softly-spoken economist has been
  warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply
  growth would eventually lead to rising prices.
schlesinger now has a majority of support in the bundesbank
  council, and since late summer poehl has had to represent his
  views, bankers said.
"poehl is in a minority in his own house," said commerzbank's
  pfister.
"poehl is in a dilemma.
he must follow a policy that is not
  entirely his own," said another economist.
the dilemma is that if german interest rates rise too far,
  they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark
  and hurting west german exporters.
the dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the
  bundesbank's new tack became clear in early october.
since last thursday, united states treasury secretary james
  baker has criticized the bundesbank rate increases.
bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986
  war of words between the u.s. and west germany, in which u.s.
  officials talked down the dollar to force west germany to
  stimulate its economy and thus suck in more u.s. exports.
one way west germany agreed to do this was making a round
  of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.
but financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for
  stoltenberg than he had bargained for.
the cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted
  most popular government politician last year, had to face
  resistance from local barons in the government coalition
  parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.
the withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising
  4.3 billion marks.
but it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will
  push up borrowing costs.
the extra amount this costs the
  government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.
meanwhile stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row
  which has turned into the country's worst political scandal.
stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in washington last
  month early to sort out a row in the northern state of
  schleswig-holstein, where he heads the ruling cdu party.
the state's cdu premier, uwe barschel, had to resign after
  allegations of a "dirty tricks" election campaign led to heavy
  losses for the cdu in state elections.
barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in geneva last
  weekend.
police say the death appears to have been suicide.
cooperation between poehl and stoltenberg is all the more
  remarkable as poehl is in the opposition social democrats, and
  was appointed by former chancellor helmut schmidt.
when poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this
  year, chancellor helmut kohl's cdu-led coalition government
  gave poehl another eight-year term.
werner chrobok, managing partner at bethmann bank, said he
  hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.
but when poehl criticized stoltenberg's tax plans he was
  not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the
  bundesbank's independence of government, chrobok said.
papers say venezuelan central bank chief to resign
  venezuelan central bank president hernan
  anzola has submitted his resignation and asked president jaime
  lusinchi to transfer him to a post in the oil industry, two
  leading venezuelan newspapers reported.
the el universal and el nacional papers said anzola would
  leave his position soon.
lusinchi already has decided on his
  successor, the el nacional reported.
central bank officials were not available for comment.
banking sources said anzola differed with the finance
  ministry over economic policy, particularly over the direction
  of interest rates.
he favoured raising the rates, which are
  currently well below the annual inflation rate of 33.2 pct.
but the sources said he ran into opposition from finance
  ministry and government officials who thought an interest
  increase would fuel inflation.

balladur insists on maintenance of louvre accords
  french finance minister edouard balladur
  issued a firm call for the continued faithful application of
  the louvre accords on currency stability by all major
  industrial countries.
balladur, responding to weekend remarks by u.s. treasury
  secretary james baker that the u.s. would take another look at
  the accords, said "i firmly desire a faithfull and firm
  adherence by all the major industrial countries to the louvre
  accords -- in both their letter and spirit."
on sunday, baker said last week's rise in short-term west
  german interest rates was not in keeping with the accords.
the louvre accords, agreed in paris last february, called
  for stability among the major currencies after a prolonged
  dollar slide.
the accords were reaffirmed by the group of seven finance
  ministers in washington last month.
but baker said at the weekend that the west german rate
  rise was "not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to."
"what i'm really saying is that they should not expect us to
  simply sit back here and accept increased tightening on their
  part on the assumption that somehow we are going to follow
  them," he added.
iran warns u.s. against raising tension in gulf
  iran warned the united states on monday
  against exacerbating the gulf crisis, saying it would endanger
  american interests.
tehran radio, monitored by the british broadcasting
  corporation, said a spokesman for iran's war information
  headquarters was responding "to u.s. officials' remarks about
  taking military action against iran."
the radio also quoted an iranian foreign ministry spokesman
  as saying iran would respond decisively to any aggressive
  measure by the united states.
the radio said the spokesman made the statement "following
  the attack on a kuwaiti ship under the u.s.
flag and comments
  by american officials on carrying out retaliatory action
  against iran."
the spokesman said, "any u.s. military aggression against
  iran will certainly be the beginning of an extensive clash in
  the persian gulf, and amidst this our principled policy is to
  confront any act which escalates tension."
norway's current account in deficit
  norway's current account showed a 9.9
  billion crown deficit for the first seven months of 1987,
  against a 19.7 billion crown deficit for the same year-ago
  period, the central bureau of statistics said.
north sea oil and gas revenues rose 3.4 pct to 32.6 billion
  crowns in the january to july period compared with 31.5 billion
  in the first seven months of 1986.
reuter
bonn ministry has no comment on baker remarks
  the west german finance ministry declined to
  comment on weekend criticism by u.s. treasury secretary james
  baker of recent west german interest rate increases.
baker said the u.s. would re-examine the february louvre
  accord to stabilise currencies reached by leading industrial
  democracies.
the rise in west germany short term interest rates
  was not in the spirit of an agreement by these nations in
  washington, which reaffirmed the louvre pact, he said.
a finance ministry spokesman, asked for an official
  ministry reaction to baker's remarks, said he could make no
  comment.
animal feed ship on fire again at chinese port
  the cyprus vessel fearless, 31,841 tonnes
  dw, which was on fire, grounded then towed to yantai, china, in
  august, had all its cargo reloaded but the cargo in the no.
3
  hold caught fire on october 15.
the fire was put out with salt water and water from the
  no.4 hold has spread over most of the cargo.
some water is also
  in the no.5 hold.
bottom patching was reported complete but
  only the no.4 starboard wing tank has been pumped out and
  remains dry.
the engine room is flooded to about three metres.
the ship was originally loaded with 10,000 tonnes of animal
  feed.
higher spending expected in malaysia's 1988 budget
  malaysia's recovery from the worst
  recession in 20 years should receive a boost on friday when the
  government announces a reflationary budget for calendar 1988
  after seven years of austerity, economists said.
"our country is walking on one leg now," said ismail salleh,
  an economist with the institute of strategic and international
  studies.
"it has to depend on public sector investment for
  faster growth if the private sector is not moving."
gross domestic product grew one pct in 1986 after shrinking
  one pct in 1985.
the fiscal year ends december 31.
the government has said it expects 1987 growth to be under
  two pct but some analysts believe it will be nearer three pct
  because prices for commodity exports have risen sharply.
malaysia is a leading exporter of rubber, palm oil, tin and
  semiconductors and a major producer of cocoa, timber and oil.
the government slashed development spending to 9.8 billion
  ringgit this year from 14.5 billion in 1986.
economists said unemployment is expected to exceed 10 pct
  in 1988 against about 9.5 pct this year.
local investment also has stagnated, with businessmen
  blaming inconsistent economic policies and lack of incentives.
one businessman said too many politicians give the
  impression that malaysia was unstable.
"if we can take care of investment confidence, the potential
  to recover strongly is great," a banker said.
malaysia's 1987 current account is expected to be in the
  black with the central bank projecting a 500 mln ringgit
  surplus compared with last year's 1.2 billion ringgit deficit.
the government has said its fiscal policies will balance
  the budget by 1989.
the deficit in 1986 was 952 mln ringgit.
the government will also repay some of its external debt,
  which stood at 51 billion ringgit at the end of 1986.
political leaders have said the budget will not hurt
  ordinary people as taxes on basic food and other essential
  goods are unlikely to change.
businessmen said they hope the government also will cut the
  corporate tax, now between 45 and 48 pct, to enable malaysia to
  compete for investors with neighbouring states.
british bauxite vessel grounded in orinoco river
  lloyds shipping intelligence service said
  the british bulk carrier envoy, 75,453 tonnes dw, was grounded
  at mile 190 in the orinoco river on october 16.
the vessel was on a voyage from trombetas, brazil, to
  matanzas, cuba, carrying 50,000 tonnes of bauxite.
its draught
  was 36 feet.
attempts to refloat the vessel with the help of six tugs
  have been unsuccessful.
the owners are considering unloading
  part of the cargo onto barges.
china forecasts 397 mln tonnes grain harvest
  china expects its 1987 grain harvest to be
  397 mln tonnes, eight mln tonnes short of its target, the new
  china news agency quoted a state statistical bureau spokesman
  as saying.
the harvest will be china's second highest in history but
  poor weather and low incentives for grain-producing farmers
  have kept yields down, earlier chinese press reports said.
industry sources expect china to import at least 10 mln
  tonnes of grain this year because of the harvest shortfall.
chinese customs figures showed grain imports of 9.59 mln
  tonnes in the first eight months of 1987, compared with 6.09
  mln in the same 1986 period.
agriculture minister he kang said last month state prices
  for grain purchase from growers were to be adjusted to increase
  the incentive for grain production.
china could not afford to become a major food importer, he
  said.
the state statistics bureau spokesman also said china's
  1987 cotton output was expected to rise 10 pct over 1986 to 390
  mln tonnes.
philippine inflation predicted to rise
  the philippine 1987 inflation rate will
  rise to 4.8 pct from 0.74 pct in 1986 if the government
  implements an employers' association recommendation for a 10
  pct increase in the 54 peso minimum daily wage this month,
  economic planning secretary solita monsod said.
the government's own proposal for an across-the-board daily
  pay rise of six pesos for non-agricultural workers and eight
  pesos for agriculture workers, would push the full year average
  higher to 5.4 pct, she told the senate last week.
the 10 pct rise in the minimum wage is recommended by the
  employers confederation of the philippines (ecop).
the ecop proposal would push the year-on-year inflation
  rate to 11.6 pct in december compared with the predicted 14.4
  pct if the government's recommendation is implemented, solita
  said.
both were proposed last month.
annual inflation for 1987 was forecast at four to 4.5 pct
  by the national economic and development authority early this
  month.
in the first three months of the year, inflation was a
  negative 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 pct respectively, rising to 1.0, 2.5
  and 4.6 pct in april may and june, the national statistics
  office said.
the annual inflation rate rose to 5.8 pct in june, 6.2 pct
  in july and 6.15 and 6.188 pct in august and september
  respectively, the national statistics office said.
it attributed the acceleration to higher fuel and water
  prices.
the government's six and eight peso wage increases would
  displace up to 20,000 workers, monsod said, bringing the number
  of unemployed to 4.2 mln or 19.2 pct of the population.
volkskas bank sees rand hinging on inflation rate
  south africa must drive down its
  inflation rate to much lower levels to prevent a further
  decline in the rand, said volkskas bank in its monthly economic
  review.
the bank said that without a major drop in the inflation
  rate, the rand was bound to eventually decrease even more,
  regardless of a sharp rise in the gold price.
inflation is running at an annual rate of some 17 pct and
  the rand is around 49.53 u.s.
cents.
most economists estimate
  continued high inflation.
volkskas predicted the rand will remain fairly steady for
  the rest of 1987 and then ease slightly next year.
soviet sugar consumption up as home brewing grows
  a sharp rise in soviet sugar consumption
  since the start of the kremlin's anti-alcohol drive indicates
  home brewing is costing the state 20 billion roubles in lost
  vodka sales, pravda said.
the communist party newspaper said sugar sales had
  increased by one mln tonnes a year, enough to be turned into
  two billion bottles of moonshine.
at current vodka prices of 10 roubles a bottle, it said,
  this meant illicit alcohol consumption had reached the
  equivalent of 20 billion roubles a year, or annual revenues
  from vodka sales before the may 1985 anti-alchohol decree.
"official statistics show a reduction in consumption of
  vodka, but this is a deceptive statistic -- it does not count
  home-brew," pravda said.
"the epidemic first engulfed the villages and has now also
  firmly settled into cities, where the availability of natural
  gas, running water and privacy has made it much easier."
kremlin leader mikhail gorbachev launched the anti-alcohol
  campaign shortly after taking office in march 1985 as a first
  step to improving soviet economic performance, which had been
  seriously hurt by drunkenness among the working population.
equiticorp holding in guinness reaches 59.93 pct

  or has received acceptances representing 59.93 pct of the
  issued ordinary share capital of guinness peat group plc
  &lt;gnsp.l>, equiticorp said in a statement.
equiticorp's offer for guinness peat became unconditional
  on october 3, when it had 50.6 pct, and closed on october 17.
banks extend trading halt in lebanese pound
  lebanon's bankers association said it
  extended its suspension of trading in the lebanese pound for
  two more working days to study ways to stem the currency's
  collapse.
the central bank did not post the rate of the pound to the
  dollar and other currencies on monday.
the pound closed on
  thursday at 407.00/412.00 to the dollar compared with
  wednesday's close of 384.00/386.00.
association sources told reuters friday's suspension of
  trading for two working days was continued on monday for two
  more days so as to study proposals to reinforce the pound.
the association, which comprises 106 commercial banks in
  east and west beirut, halted trading on friday in a chaotic
  market after the pound crashed to four record lows in the week.
the pound, hit by the inability of lebanon's religiously
  and ideologically divided government to end 12 years of civil
  war, has lost more than 80 pct of its international value this
  year.
statoil places north sea veslefrikk field orders
  den norske stats oljeselskap a/s (statoil)
  &lt;stat.ol>, operator on norway's north sea veslefrikk oil field,
  has placed field development contracts totalling 1.5 billion
  crowns with two domestic yards, the company said in a
  statement.
moss rosenberg verft, a subsidiary of kvaerner industrier
  a/s &lt;kvio.ol> won a 1.2 billion crown contract to convert
  statoil's semisubmersible rig west vision to a floating
  production platform and to build the deck for a separate, fixed
  well-head platform to be placed on the field, it said.
statoil said aker verdal, a unit of aker norcem a/s
  &lt;amvo.ol>, won a 300-mln crown contract to design and build the
  well-head platform's 10,000-tonne steel substructure, to stand
  in 150 metres of water next to the converted rig.
statoil said using a floating production unit rather than a
  fixed platform would cut construction time, enabling field
  partners to bring veslefrikk on stream in late 1989 -- several
  months earlier than previously planned.
veslefrikk, with estimated recoverable reserves of 258 mln
  barrels oil and 140 billion cubic feet gas, is located 145 km
  west of bergen.
statoil estimates the field's total development cost,
  including drilling, at 6.6 billion crowns.
planned daily output
  is 65,000 barrels oil and 35 mln cubic feet gas.
veslefrikk's oil will be landed via the nearby oseberg
  field pipeline at the sture crude terminal near bergen.
its gas
  will be fed into the statpipe line, which gathers gas from
  norway's statfjord, gullfaks and oseberg fields.
partners on the field are statoil, the operator, with a 55
  pct share, &lt;unocal norge a/s> (18 pct), &lt;deminex (norge) a/s>
  (13.5 pct), norsk hydro a/s &lt;nhy.ol> (nine pct) and &lt;svenska
  petroleum ab> (4.5 pct).
louvre accord still in effect, japan official says
  the group of seven (g-7) industrial nations
  still comply with last february's louvre accord to stabilize
  currencies, a senior bank of japan official said.
and u.s. treasury secretary james baker's remarks at the
  weekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lower
  range for the dollar, other senior officials from the bank of
  japan and finance ministry agreed in interviews.
"the exchange market is apparently reacting too much, and
  anyone who sold the dollar on the baker comment will regret it
  later on," the bank of japan official told reuters.
the bank official said baker did not mean to talk the
  dollar down.
a lower dollar would harm the u.s. economy, he
  noted.
a finance ministry official who was directly involved in
  monetary talks with other nations also said the u.s. would
  never attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar
  against the mark or the yen.
the market assumes the dollar reference range to be between
  140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks.
the dollar closed in tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and
  141.35 yen.
"behind baker's remark was u.s.
frustration over higher
  interest rates abroad, especially in west germany, but this
  does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework
  of the louvre accord," the finance ministry official said.
he said that on the contrary baker wanted to avoid any
  further rise in u.s. interest rates because it would not only
  hurt the u.s. economy but aggravate the third world debt
  problem.
higher u.s. interest rates would merely raise their
  interest payment burden and depress u.s. stock and bond markets
  further, the monetary officials said.
both the ministry and central bank officials, who declined
  to be named, noted the u.s. no longer wants to see a further
  decline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary
  expectations in the u.s.
      "that's why baker did not fail to add that the louvre
  agreement is still operative," the senior ministry official
  said.
baker said in a u.s. television interview on sunday that
  washington would reexamine the louvre accord because of west
  germany's increase in short-term interest rates.
the market at first interpreted this as indicating the u.s.
  would be ready to scrap the louvre accord and let the dollar
  decline further unless surplus countries, notably west germany,
  try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the
  accord, foreign exchange dealers said.
but the market on reflection also noted baker's additional
  statement that "the louvre agreement is still operative," and
  this caused some dollar short-covering in tokyo today, the
  dealers said.
uncertainty, however, remained the flavour of the day in
  tokyo currency markets.
the japanese monetary officials said baker's undisguised
  pressure on west germany to refrain from guiding interest rates
  higher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance,
  or international economic policy coordination.
the g-7, comprising the u.s., japan, west germany, britain,
  france, italy and canada, have agreed to monitor each other's
  economic policies and from time to time apply "peer pressure" to
  persuade others to change their policies to a desired course,
  they noted.
"without such a basic agreement of multilateral
  surveillance, baker would never have criticized the west german
  policy so openly," the ministry official said.
the u.s.-west german squabble over bonn's monetary policy
  should thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy
  coordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse
  of the louvre agreement, the official said.
he also said japan has not received any specific request
  from the u.s. on its monetary policy, although its short-term
  money rates have been edging higher.
"this is because we, unlike the germans, are not taking
  policy to guide interest rates higher, and the marginal rate
  rise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons," he
  added.

rubber stock manager says quality acceptable
  international rubber organisation
  (inro) buffer stock manager aldo hofmeister said tests had
  shown the quality of rubber in stock was acceptable, but
  acknowledged that some consumers were now wary of buying it.
"we have said all along that the rubber is holding up well
  from a condition and quality standpoint...rubber stored in
  proper conditions does not deteriorate," he told reuters in a
  telephone interview.
the quality of buffer stock rubber sold
  since he entered the market in september would be discussed at
  an inro council meeting which opened here today, he said.
tokyo traders said on friday they had little interest in
  buying rubber from the inro buffer stock because of possible
  poor quality.
hofmeister began selling rubber when prices exceeded the
  "may-sell' level of 232 cents per kg early last month.
inro's
  five-day moving average was quoted at 237.3 cents on october
  16.
he said the quality of five to six-year old rubber in stock
  was uppermost in consumers' minds.
"we have received good interest for the rubber.
i understand
  the japanese concern.
many consumers want to try the rubber
  before they carry on buying," he said.
hofmeister said inro rubber was stored in 28 different
  locations in producing and consuming nations, adding all
  warehouses used were suitable for long-term storage.
selling of buffer stock rubber had levelled off during the
  past week to 10 days and this could reflect a "wait and see
  attitude" by buyers, he said.
"consumers are holding back from buying additional amounts
  until they test out the rubber.
if their tests are positiive,
  they are likely to buy more."
hofmeister said he could reduce
  the offer price of buffer stock rubber to stimulate interest
  but inro did not want to depress prices artificially.
hofmeister declined to comment on japanese trade estimates
  that he had sold around 30,000 to 32,000 tonnes in kuala lumpur
  and new york since september.
but he said japanese traders were in a position to have an
  idea of the quantity he had sold, noting that traders overall
  had put buffer stock sales at between 25,000 and 35,000 tonnes.
the question of sales from the original 360,000 tonne
  buffer stock is expected to be the main topic of the council
  meeting which is scheduled to end on thursday.
the current international rubber pact expires on october
  22.
the deadline for the new pact's start is january 1989 and
  hofmeister has been mandated to continue selling rubber during
  the interim period.
economist urges more taxes to lower n.z.
dollar
  an income tax surcharge and capital
  gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of
  the n.z.
dollar, independent economist len bayliss said.
bayliss, a former economist with the reserve bank and the
  bank of new zealand, said a major depreciation is needed to
  restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by
  current government policies.
the taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turn
  would lower the value of the n.z.
dollar, he said in a speech.
he added that the deficit for the year ending march 1988 could
  be much higher than the government's 1.3 billion dlr forecast.
since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a
  percentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase was
  probably unavoidable, bayliss said.
he would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct
  value-added goods and services tax, introduced in october 1986,
  but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact.
import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary
  impact of a currency depreciation.
the government had failed to bring inflation down despite
  lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added.
new zealand's inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year to
  end-september against 18.9 pct in the year to end june.
the major deficiency in the government's anti-inflation
  policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and
  insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, bayliss
  said.
the government had also failed to reduce overseas debt
  and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit.
"the widespread belief that (new zealand's) problems are
  going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought
  is soundly based -- primarily because the government's
  macro-economic policies have been unsuccessful," bayliss said.
philippine trade gap widens in january-august
  the philippines' trade deficit widened to
  542 mln dlrs in the eight months to end-august from 159 mln
  dlrs in the same 1986 period, the national statistics office
  said.
it said exports in the eight-month period rose to 3.58
  billion dlrs from 3.18 billion in 1986, while imports rose to
  4.12 billion dlrs from 3.34 billion a year earlier.
the country's trade deficit totalled 202 mln dlrs in 1986.
new zealand imposes sanctions against fiji
  new zealand has imposed sanctions
  against fiji in response to that country's change of status to
  a republic, acting prime minister geoffrey palmer said.
the sanctions will end all military cooperation and cut
  economic aid.
new zealand will also not renew an agreement
  which supports the price of fijian sugar when it expires in
  march.
the loss of aid and sugar supports will cost fiji about
  10 mln dlrs a year.
palmer told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the
  government had asked high commissioner rod gates to return from
  suva for discussions about other possible measures.
"we won't be reacting further until these discussions with
  the high commissioner and the prime minister have been held,"
  palmer said.
the sanctions were approved by the cabinet soon after
  colonel sitivene rabuka staged his second coup on september 25.
implementation was postponed in the hope that rabuka might turn
  back from declaring a republic.
palmer said the cabinet was happy with the statement from
  commonwealth leaders in vancouver that fiji's membership of the
  commonwealth had lapsed.
prime minister david lange is in
  hawaii on his way home from vancouver.
uganda plans to export roasted coffee to europe
  uganda plans to export roasted coffee to
  europe by the end of 1988, a prominent local businessman said.
a.r.
sendi said on sunday that uganda's ministry of
  industry supports his plan to build a factory to roast, grind
  and pack local coffee for export.
construction will start in
  december and the factory should be ready by next october.
he said the marketing ministry has authorised the coffee
  marketing board to supply his company &lt;unipack> with 24,000
  tonnes of beans a year for processing and export.
sendi also
  told reporters he had negotiated a 69.7 mln french franc loan
  from the banque industrielle d'afrique oriental in paris.
uganda is the world's fifth largest coffee producer, and
  expects to produce about 200,000 tonnes this year.
market sources say roasted coffee exports will benefit
  uganda's economy as they will not be included in the 2.38 mln
  (60 kg) bag export quota assigned to the country under the
  latest international coffee agreement.
in addition, the value of roasted coffee should be
  substantially higher than that of unroasted beans, they said.
the u.s. is the biggest buyer of ugandan coffee, most of
  which is used to produce instant coffee.
iran, soviet union to swap crude, refined products
  the soviet union has agreed to supply
  iran with refined oil products in exchange for 100,000 barrels
  per day of crude, iran's national news agency, irna, said.
irna, monitored in nicosia, quoted oil minister gholamreza
  aqazadeh as saying on his return to tehran from moscow that the
  agreement was part of a protocol on economic cooperation signed
  during his visit.
the amount of crude delivered to the soviet
  union might double to 200,000 bpd later, he said.
aqazadeh said the two sides agreed to conduct feasibility
  studies for a pipeline to take iranian crude from fields in
  southern iran to the black sea through the soviet union.
iran is pursuing the pipeline project to protect part of
  its oil exports from iraqi air attacks in the gulf.
irna made no mention of natural gas exports to the soviet
  union, which aqazadeh had said would be discussed before he
  left for moscow.
iran lost most of its refining capacity early in the gulf
  war and now imports several hundred thousand bpd of refined
  products.
aqazadeh said soviet refined products would be delivered at
  the caspian sea ports of anzali and nowshahr, at neka, near the
  caspian, and at jolfa in north-west iran.

tokyo dealers see dollar poised to breach 140 yen
  tokyo's foreign exchange market is watching
  nervously to see if the u.s. dollar will drop below the
  significant 140.00 yen level, dealers said.
"the 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it is
  considered to be the lower end of the reference range.
if the
  currency breaks through this level, it may decline sharply,"
  said hirozumi tanaka, assistant general manager at dai-ichi
  kangyo bank ltd's international treasury division.
the dollar was at 141.10 yen at midday against friday
  closes of 142.35/45 in new york and 141.35 here.
the dollar opened at 140.95 yen and fell to a low of
  140.40.
it was 1.7733/38 marks against 1.7975/85 in new york
  and 1.8008/13 here on friday, after an opening 1.7700/10.
the currency's decline was due to remarks on sunday by u.s.
  treasury secretary james baker, dealers said.
"the dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearish
  sentiment after baker's comments," said dai-ichi's tanaka.
he
  said this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation among
  the group of seven (g-7) industrial nations to implement the
  louvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying.
the dollar's fall was also prompted by a record one-day
  drop in the dow jones industrial average on friday and weakness
  in u.s.
bond prices, dealers said.
baker said the louvre accord was still operative but he
  strongly criticised west german moves to raise key interest
  rates.
operators took baker's comment to indicate impatience
  with some g-7 members for failing to stick to the louvre accord
  due to their fears of increasing inflation.
rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationary
  pressures also slow domestic demand.
west germany and japan had both pledged at g-7 meetings to
  boost domestic demand to help narrow the huge u.s. trade
  deficit, tanaka said.
u.s. august trade data showed the u.s. deficit at a still
  massive 15.68 billion dlrs.
but if west germany raises interest
  rates, this would run counter to the pledge, he said.
"operators are now waiting to see if the g-7 nations
  coordinate dollar buying intervention," said soichi hirabayashi,
  deputy general manager of fuju bank ltd's foreign exchange
  department.
the target range set by the louvre accord is generally
  considered to be 140.00 to 160.00 yen, dealers said.
"the market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the near
  future and at that time, if operators see the g-7 nations
  failing to coordinate intervention, they would see the louvre
  accord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively,"
  hirabayashi said.
he said the u.s. currency could fall as low
  as 135 yen soon.
japan/india conference cuts gulf war risk charges
  the japan/india-pakistan-gulf/japan
  shipping conference said it would cut the extra risk insurance
  surcharges on shipments to iranian and iraqi ports to a minimum
  three pct from 4.5 pct on october 25.
it said surcharges on shipments of all break-bulk cargoes
  to non-iraqi arab ports would be reduced to 3.0 pct from 4.5.
a conference spokesman declined to say why the move was
  taken at a time of heightened tension in the gulf.
soviet industrial growth/trade slower in 1987
  the soviet union's industrial output is
  growing at a slower pace in 1987 than in 1986 and foreign trade
  has fallen, central statistical office figures show.
figures in the communist party newspaper pravda show
  industrial production rose 3.6 pct in the first nine months of
  1987 against 5.2 pct in the same 1986 period.
foreign trade in the same period fell 3.6 pct from the 1986
  period as exports fell by 0.5 pct and imports dropped by 4.2
  pct.
foreign trade in the nine months totalled 94.2 billion
  roubles.
separate import and export figures were not given.
one factor affecting industrial growth was the introduction
  of a new quality control plan, western economists said.
last
  year's calculations of industrial output included all goods,
  irrespective of quality.
under the new plan, introduced in line with soviet leader
  mikhail gorbachev's drive to modernise the economy, special
  inspectors have the right to reject goods they consider below
  standard.
pravda said 42 mln roubles worth of defective goods were
  rejected in the nine-month period.
the figures also showed that on october 1, there were more
  than 8,000 cooperative enterprises employing over 80,000
  people.
more than 200,000 were employed in the private sector,
  pravda said, without giving comparative figures.
the promotion of the cooperative and private sectors of the
  economy has been an important part of the modernisation
  campaign, with measures introduced recently to allow the
  setting up of small shops on a private basis.
labour productivity rose 3.7 pct in the first nine months
  against 4.8 pct growth in january to september 1986.
but western economists said they treat soviet productivity
  figures with caution, as they are more broadly based than in
  the west, which measures worker output over a given period.
pravda said there were 283.8 mln people in the soviet union
  as of october 1.
in the january to september 1987 period 118.5
  mln people were employed, a rise of 4.4 pct on the same period
  last year.
average earnings were 200 roubles a month against
  194 roubles a year ago.
